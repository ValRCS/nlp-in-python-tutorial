{"transcript":{"ali":"Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, \u2019cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um\u2026 It\u2019s a very exciting day for me. It\u2019s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I\u2019m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought\u2026 is \u201cFuck you.\u201d \u201cFuck you. I don\u2019t even know you, but fuck you!\u201d \u2018Cause I\u2019m straight up jealous. I\u2019m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there\u2019s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through.\nAnd then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don\u2019t have insomnia yet. They don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don\u2019t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It\u2019s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don\u2019t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It\u2019s coming. You don\u2019t have HPV yet, you\u2019re a fucking loser, all right? That\u2019s what that says about you. A lot of men don\u2019t know that they have HPV, because it\u2019s undetectable in men. It\u2019s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men\u2019s bodies and says, \u201cBoo!\u201d in women\u2019s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that\u2019s gonna turn into cervical cancer\u2026 \u2026or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I\u2019m gonna die\u2026 or you\u2019re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We\u2019ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I\u2019m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I\u2019m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I\u2019m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that\u2019s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That\u2019s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I\u2019m a horrible person, I\u2019m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\nI have a hoarding problem, which I\u2019m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I\u2019m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator\u2019s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, \u2019cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you\u2019re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don\u2019t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82\u2026 manual. The manual. She don\u2019t even know\u2026 where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don\u2019t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson\u2019s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, \u201cYou never know when you might need this.\u201d And I was like, \u201cBut\u2026 I do know\u2026 that I\u2019m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that\u2019s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.\u201d I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I\u2019m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They\u2019re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he\u2019s\u2013 he\u2019s much better looking than me, he\u2019s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, \u201cOh, my God, who is that?\u201d And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m gonna trap his ass.\u201d \u201cGoing to trap his ass!\u201d And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, \u201cAll right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.\u201d When, really, it\u2019s a public park\u2026 \u2026that has hosted many reggae fests\u2026 \u2026and has even accidentally let\u2026 two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing\u2026 for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to\u2026 It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had\u2026 We had so much chemistry. He was like, \u201cHey, wassup?\u201d I was like, \u201cWassup?\u201d And we\u2013 The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, \u201cHey, can you drop me off?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhere?\u201d He was like, \u201cAt the park.\u201d And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, \u201cOh, no!\u201d \u201cI just fucked a homeless dude! Again!\u201d My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It\u2019s\u2026 too much. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very\u2026 You feel very picturesque when you\u2019re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you\u2019re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it\u2019s very, you know, it\u2019s hot hookin\u2019 up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I\u2019m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement\u2026 \u2026you know, just right there, through the money hole and just\u2026 And then also, he\u2019s so vulnerable down there. I\u2019m, like, \u201cI could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!\u201d You know?\nBut I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home\u2026 and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don\u2019t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It\u2019s\u2026 amazing. It\u2019s what love is built on, you know?\nMy last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, \u201cHold it. You guys aren\u2019t Mexican?\u201d Asian-American men are very underrated. I don\u2019t know why people don\u2019t go for them. They\u2019re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It\u2019s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It\u2019s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It\u2019s all red and inflamed and you\u2019re like, \u201cI did not ask to be exfoliated today.\u201d \u201cThis is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.\u201d And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That\u2019s where the umami flavor comes from.\nI think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he\u2019s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I\u2019m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we\u2019re both half-fancy Asian\u2026 \u2026and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn\u2019t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, \u201cIt\u2019s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!\u201d I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s not authentic, OK?\u201d You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, \u2019cause it don\u2019t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That\u2019s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that\u2019s like\u2026 \u2026a thousand percent of your daily fiber\u2026 and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about\u2026 \u2026supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it\u2019s funny, right, because he\u2019s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do\u2026 makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall\u2026 and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We\u2019re like, \u201cOh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I\u2013 I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose\u2026 because\u2026 I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women\u2019s intuition. That\u2019s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man\u2019s head. First passively and then if he doesn\u2019t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you\u2019re too old and it\u2019s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, \u201cShut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?\u201d And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, \u201cOh, my God! He proposed!\u201d \u201cIt came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something\u2026 that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.\u201d Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page\u2026 he\u2019s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday\u2026 because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That\u2019s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I\u2019m a completely different person. You\u2013 Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I\u2019m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We\u2019ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I\u2019ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he\u2019d become dependent on me. \u2018Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\u2019t. I straight up don\u2019t wanna work anymore. I don\u2019t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. \u2018Cause I don\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\u2019ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she\u2019s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don\u2019t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, \u201cWe\u2019re dumb women. We don\u2019t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.\u201d \u201c\u2018Cause we\u2019re too stupid to have any real responsibility.\u201d And then, all these women had to show off and be like, \u201cWe could do it! We could do anything.\u201d \u201cBitch, shut up!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t tell them the secret.\u201d They ruined it for us, and now we\u2019re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, \u201cDouble-income household,\u201d I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they\u2019re like, \u201cBut, Ali, we have so many more options now.\u201d Oh, you don\u2019t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it?\nA lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they\u2019ll get very judgmental about housewives that we\u2019ll see on the street. And they\u2019ll be like, \u201cLook at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cThat bitch is a genius.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s not a housewife, she\u2019s retired.\u201d\nI do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is\u2026 It\u2019s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It\u2019s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it\u2019s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don\u2019t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don\u2019t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don\u2019t gotta\u2026 \u2026ten times a day, every day\u2026 like you\u2019re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don\u2019t gotta do that. They don\u2019t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that\u2019s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It\u2019s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired \u2019cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed \u2019cause you\u2019re paranoid that your co-worker\u2019s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no! Courtney\u2019s listening. She\u2019s waiting. She\u2019s timing me.\u201d And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it\u2019s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don\u2019t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don\u2019t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don\u2019t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don\u2019t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want.\nYou know, it\u2019s\u2013 it\u2019s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, \u201cYou need to get to work on time.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou need to eat bananas.\u201d \u201cI saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don\u2019t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.\u201d My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, \u201cHey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don\u2019t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, \u2018I do,\u2019 what I really meant was, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m done.'\u201d I\u2019m done. I don\u2019t wanna work anymore and I\u2019m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I\u2019ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That\u2019s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just\u2026 Let\u2019s redecorate.\nI gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I\u2019m a\u2013 I\u2019m a disgusting pervert. I\u2019m a pervert. I\u2019m a gross filthy animal. And I think it\u2019s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that\u2026 y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it\u2019s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you.\nI broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, \u201cUh, you\u2019re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist\u2026 and posted \u2018Tiny Asian female seeking anal\u2026\u2019 the Internet would crash.\u201d \u201cAnd all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.\u201d They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know\u2026 freaked out about anal. And they\u2019re like, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t wanna do that. I\u2019m scared of\u2013 of the pain.\u201d You ain\u2019t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You\u2019re not scared of the pain. What you\u2019re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You\u2019re scared that he\u2019s gonna see that and that\u2019s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can\u2019t help you now. But don\u2019t worry, \u2019cause when he puts it in the butt, all he\u2019s thinking about is, \u201cI just put it in her butt.\u201d \u201cI gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.\u201d You\u2019re\u2013 If you\u2019re married, you\u2019re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don\u2019t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I\u2019m a little bit\u2026 \u2026stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, \u201cOh, my God! It\u2019s like I\u2019m going back in time!\u201d \u266a A whole new world \u266a It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to\u2026 Now, if you haven\u2019t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your\u2013 Just give your man a little\u2013 a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you\u2019ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You\u2019ll get a lot of \u201cNo! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don\u2019t\u2013 No! I don\u2019t! I don\u2019t! No!\u201d They get all squirmy wormy because\u2026 they\u2019re scared. They\u2019re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they\u2019re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man\u2019s eye like he\u2019s discovered nirvana. And it\u2019s like you\u2019re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When\u2013 When I\u2019ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. \u201cHey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?\u201d I\u2019m, like, \u201cYes, I know you respect me and that\u2019s why you need to abuse me. OK?\u201d \u2018Cause it\u2019s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their\u2013 Glasses always means the woman wants some\u2013 It\u2019s because we\u2019re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, \u201cI don\u2019t wanna die! Don\u2019t kill me! I don\u2019t wanna die!\u201d But I also don\u2019t want to be sure that I\u2019m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just\u2013 Just choke me enough so that I can\u2019t talk. \u2018Cause if I can talk, I\u2019m gonna tell you what to do. And I\u2019m tired of being the boss. I\u2019m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I\u2019m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word \u201cbossy\u201d in elementary schools, because according to her, it\u2019s sexist to use the word \u201cbossy,\u201d because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, \u201cYou\u2019re bossy,\u201d you\u2019re supposed to say, \u201cYou have executive leadership skills.\u201d Which is a very roundabout way of saying: \u201cYou\u2019re a little cunt.\u201d I\u2019m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I\u2019m talking about? I\u2019m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That\u2019s the kind of income bracket I\u2019m striving for. That\u2019s when you know you\u2019ve made it, when you\u2019re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango\u2026 \u2026Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pineapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don\u2019t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It\u2019s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics\u2026 don\u2019t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There\u2019s\u2013 None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That\u2019s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they\u2019ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they\u2019ll be like, \u201cGuys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby\u2019s a little piece of shit. It\u2019s so annoying and boring.\u201d And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious. I identify.\u201d And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper \u2019cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby\u2019s head shredding it up. She\u2019s busy. So, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, \u201cAli, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become\u2013 You\u2019re gonna disappear, and you\u2019re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s the dream.\u201d That\u2019s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know?\nAnother thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, \u201cWhy are you gonna have a kid? Why don\u2019t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s cool\u2026 until my husband dies.\u201d Which he\u2019s definitely gonna before me. Because I\u2019m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I\u2019m a billion. I\u2019m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase \u201cblack don\u2019t crack.\u201d Well, Asian don\u2019t die. We don\u2019t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we\u2019re such bad drivers? Because we\u2019re trying to die. We\u2019re like, \u201cYeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!\u201d \u201cImma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m gonna make a right turn\u2013 I changed my mind, it\u2019s a U-turn!\u201d \u201cI changed my mind again. It\u2019s a O-turn!\u201d Every time I get into a car accident\u2026 \u2026I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God, not again!\u201d I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn\u2019t see that it\u2019s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There\u2019s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there\u2019s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me, but I\u2019m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It\u2019s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. \u2018Cause she knows that she\u2019s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I\u2019m just kidding. She doesn\u2019t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I\u2019m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn\u2019t around to support me anymore. I\u2019m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That\u2019s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don\u2019t give a fuck. They got no shame. They\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m just gonna recycle\u2026 go bald\u2026 go to the park, do this shit.\u201d They do that \u2019cause it\u2019s a free activity. For them. They do it in their\u2013 their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who\u2019s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I\u2019m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it\u2013 And it scared me. Like, I\u2019m only 33 and\u2026 \u2026my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It\u2019s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just\u2026 \u201cI slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!\u201d I don\u2019t know what kind of mother I\u2019m gonna be. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that\u2026 is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker\u2019s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. \u201cUh, mmm.\u201d They watch Property Brothers, scratch, \u201cWhat\u2019s crackin\u2019? Mmm.\u201d Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, \u201cWhen can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026smell my fingers?\u201d Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, \u2019cause you gotta check that it\u2019s all good in the hood. If it\u2019s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, \u201cOh, my God, that\u2019s so hot. You guys doin\u2019 a lot of fuckin\u2019?\u201d No, dude. That\u2019s\u2013 That\u2019s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in\u2013 When you\u2019re in your 30s, and you\u2019ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin\u2019. It tells you when it\u2019s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, \u201cWe\u2019re not fuckin\u2019. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it\u2019s like, \u2018Release the Kraken!'\u201d And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um\u2026 yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn\u2019t even have sex, \u2019cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I\u2019d be like, \u201cOK, it\u2019s go time,\u201d and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\u2019s not because they\u2019re in such ecstasy with you that\u2013 that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it\u2019s because they\u2019re literally trying to shut the image of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn\u2019t have to see the expression on my face that says, \u201cPlease, hurry the fuck up.\u201d And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It\u2019s when they get that\u2026 that stupid-ass look on their face\u2026 \u2026where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just\u2026 And then, because we\u2019re hippies, I\u2019d be like, \u201cHey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?\u201d And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him\u2026 and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards\u2026 to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That\u2019s right. \u2018Cause I don\u2019t wanna work anymore. I\u2019m very grateful to be pregnant and to be\u2026 this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, my God. That\u2019s so dark and terrible. I can\u2019t believe that.\u201d I\u2019m 33. Girl, when you\u2019re 33, you\u2019ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It\u2019s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn\u2019t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom\u2013 She\u2019s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, \u201cUh, yeah. Where I\u2019m from, that\u2019s like losing a pair of shoes. It\u2019s whatevs, OK?\u201d And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, \u201cOh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you\u2019re having twins.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo!\u201d And then she said, \u201cBut what I don\u2019t see is a heartbeat.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYes!\u201d \u201cThe Lord is mysterious!\u201d Don\u2019t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I\u2019ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won\u2019t let their husbands watch when they\u2019re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, \u201cYou look.\u201d \u201cYou watch the whole thing.\u201d And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyonc\u00e9. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That\u2019s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I\u2019m scared about giving childbirth, though. I\u2019m\u2013 I\u2019m very, very scared of childbirth. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That\u2019s a white hippie witch\u2026 \u2026that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser S\u00f6ze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, \u201cAli, did you know that you\u2019re gonna poop on the table?\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, I look forward to it.\u201d I\u2019m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can\u2019t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you\u2013 that that happens because when you\u2019re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that\u2019s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That\u2019s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn\u2019t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. \u201cHey, can you wash the dishes?\u201d \u201cNo!\u201d \u201cCan you water the plants?\u201d \u201cI am not doing jack shit anymore. I\u2019m busy makin\u2019 a eyeball, OK? Are you makin\u2019 a foot? I didn\u2019t think so. You change the channel.\u201d I can already see how there\u2019s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor\u2019s appointments with me. \u201cOh, my God. I can\u2019t believe he comes to all your doctor\u2019s appointments. He is so supportive.\u201d Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I\u2019m the star of the show. There\u2019s nothing for the camera to see if I\u2019m not there. But he\u2019s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I\u2019m a bad mommy. You know, I\u2013 I\u2013 I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I\u2019m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis\u2026 to keep him down so that he doesn\u2019t believe that he\u2019s worthy of another woman\u2019s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don\u2019t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn\u2019t know that. I didn\u2019t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big\u2013 they get big, like fingers. Like, \u201cYou, you. You owe me money, you.\u201d My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I\u2019m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I\u2019m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy\u2019s all wet again. But it\u2019s different. It\u2019s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, \u201cWhy is it different?\u201d And I looked it up, and my pussy\u2019s all wet again because my\u2013 my body\u2019s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That\u2019s not the same. When it\u2019s straight up soldier glue, when it\u2019s Neosporin. So, you know, I\u2013 I, in\u2013 previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who\u2019s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he\u2019s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron\u2019d my ass. And now, if I don\u2019t work, we die. Why else do you think I\u2019m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I\u2019ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.","anthony":"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told \u2019em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, \u201cWhy would you do that? That\u2019s the most politically correct city in the world.\u201d Not when I\u2019m on stage, it\u2019s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It\u2019s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it\u2019s been a great day. Love that. Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby\u2019s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what\u2019s\u2026 going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You\u2019ve seen \u2019em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, \u201cHey, where you from? What do you do?\u201d She goes, \u201cOh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I\u2019m a brain surgeon.\u201d I don\u2019t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean\u2026 Most women\u2026 can\u2019t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that\u2019s just me clearing my throat. That joke\u2019s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don\u2019t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I\u2019ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn\u2019t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh\u2026 I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that\u2019s good. That\u2019s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton\u2019s son died. For inspiration. I\u2019m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn\u2019t understand the joke\u2026 don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You\u2019ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You\u2019ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that\u2019s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you\u2019re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? \u2013 Peggy Jo. \u2013 Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I\u2019m disabled. You\u2019re disabled? I know you\u2019re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. \u2013 I\u2019m an electrician. \u2013 You\u2019re an electrician? Great. That\u2019s an honorable job. That\u2019s a good job to have. I\u2019m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It\u2019s a wonderful job. There\u2019s a lot of bad jobs out there, I\u2019ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for\u2026 kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He\u2019s like\u2026 Says he\u2019s never worked a day in his life. Doesn\u2019t pay much, but the benefits\u2026 Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn\u2019t it crazy? Isn\u2019t it way more than you\u2019d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it\u2019s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you\u2019re wondering, \u201cAnthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?\u201d I don\u2019t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I\u2019ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother\u2019s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, \u201cShut the door.\u201d I said, \u201cGet inside.\u201d My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. \u201cAnthony, please, put me in your next joke.\u201d \u201cAre you sure? I\u2019m gonna make you a pedophile.\u201d \u201cWe don\u2019t care. We wanna be part of this thing you\u2019ve got going on.\u201d So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I\u2019m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, \u201cMikey, what\u2019d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?\u201d And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, \u201cWell, crowd seemed to think it was funny\u2026 but I think it\u2019s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhat, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You\u2019re my brother. That\u2019s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.\u201d And he goes, \u201cYeah, and then you\u2019re like, \u2018Get back inside.'\u201d Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 idiot. Yeah, I\u2019ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I\u2019m the one who couldn\u2019t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it\u2019s okay. It\u2019s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That\u2019s how talented I am. And I\u2019m used to it. I\u2019m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn\u2019t do anything about it. I didn\u2019t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was\u2026 \u201cNow we\u2019re even.\u201d She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me \u2019cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, \u201cAnthony, I\u2019m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.\u201d But I\u2019m a dude. All I heard was \u201ctwo weeks\u201d and \u201ccheat on me.\u201d Like my neighbors in L.A\u2026 My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin\u2019 hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she\u2019s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn\u2019t she understand how dumb that\u2019s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that\u2019s a joke. That\u2019s a joke where I\u2019m a serial killer. I\u2019m very open about it. Don\u2019t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, \u201cUncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.\u201d I said, \u201cFuck you.\u201d \u201cYou six-year-old piece of shit.\u201d And don\u2019t get me wrong. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I\u2019m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations\u2026 \u2026of how easy it\u2019s gonna be to tear off a head. I won\u2019t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you\u2019re sensitive about comedy, it\u2019s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can\u2019t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it\u2019s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can\u2019t make fun of, the thing that\u2019s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can\u2019t do it. Can\u2019t make fun of them. It\u2019s too sensitive. In fact, you can\u2019t even call them \u201cchicks with dicks\u201d anymore. No. No. You have to call them \u201cmen who talk too much.\u201d Right? But I hear this all the time. People\u2019ll be like, \u201cAnthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.\u201d And I always say, \u201cNo. No. Stupid women hate my shows.\u201d \u201cStupid women hate my shows. Smart women\u2026 don\u2019t come to my shows.\u201d Speaking of which, what\u2019s your name? \u2013 What? Kim. \u2013 Kim. \u2013 Kim, where you from? \u2013 San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I\u2019m a branch manager. \u2013 Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? \u2013 No, for\u2026 What? What the fuck? Where\u2019d you go to school? \u2013 UC Santa Cruz. \u2013 What\u2019d you study? \u2013 Economics. \u2013 Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy\u2026 Every single guy in the school, we all\u2026 shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin\u2019 it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever\u2026 You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn\u2019t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? \u2013 Yeah! \u2013 Yeah! Whoo! That\u2019s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don\u2019t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet\u2026 to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn\u2019t even let me finish the question. I don\u2019t own a gun. I\u2019m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid\u2026 When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it\u2026 to protect their four children. I\u2019m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I\u2019ll never forget\u2026 the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don\u2019t take classes. You don\u2019t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\nAs a kid, my dad\u2019s prized possession, my dad\u2019s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn\u2019t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying\u2026 but he wouldn\u2019t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin\u2019 amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should\u2019ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9\/11 so\u2026 my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should\u2019ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9\/11. I think.\nI mean, don\u2019t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That\u2019s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I\u2019d come home after school. Once in a while, I\u2019d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I\u2019d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She\u2019d pull me aside and say, \u201cAnthony, who\u2019s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?\u201d And I would say, \u201cShut up, Mom, that\u2019s racist. Put your money away.\u201d I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. \u2018Cause they\u2019re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. \u2013 What\u2019s your name? \u2013 Melissa. \u2013 Melissa, where you from? \u2013 Santa Clara. \u2013 What do you do? \u2013 I win things on the radio. \u2013 You win things on the radio? \u2013 Yeah. Follow-up question, how\u2019d you get tickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh\u2026 you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It\u2019s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and\u2026 some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I\u2019m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer\u2026 a dear, dear friend. I\u2019m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I\u2019ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town\u2026 and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It\u2019s easy for me. I\u2019m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and\u2026 consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It\u2019s gonna get so much fuckin\u2019 worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What\u2019s your name? \u2013 Allan. \u2013 Allan, where you from? \u2013 Frisco. \u2013 Frisco. I can tell you\u2019re a local \u2019cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? \u2013 I fight fires. I fight fires. \u2013 You what? You\u2019re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? \u2013 Travel the world. \u2013 Travel the world. It\u2019s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that\u2019s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I\u2019m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. \u2018Cause no one can tell me what to do. That\u2019s all I cared about. Most people don\u2019t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about\u2026 wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies\u2026 \u2026on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it\u2019s funny. I think it\u2019s funny how the things that happen to us when we\u2019re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her\u2026 and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You\u2019re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know\u2026 Did you guys know that when a newborn baby\u2026 when a newborn baby is first born, when it\u2019s fresh out of the womb\u2026 it can actually hear and see everything around it\u2026 for up to ten seconds after it\u2019s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they\u2019ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they\u2019ve lost a baby? \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry for your loss\u201d? Doesn\u2019t cut it. \u201cAre you gonna be okay?\u201d Not even close. That\u2019s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I\u2019m not good with kids. That\u2019s my point. That\u2019s what this whole thing\u2019s about. I\u2019m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin\u2019s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin\u2019s baby on the ground. But I don\u2019t feel like that was my fault. I don\u2019t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind\u2026 who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It\u2019s okay, people hate\u2026 people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It\u2019s like, \u201cAnthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?\u201d \u201cNo one likes them, why do you insist?\u201d Well, I\u2019ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn\u2019t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn\u2019t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It\u2019s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, \u201cOh! I should have thought of that.\u201d My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn\u2019t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part\u2026 was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh\u2026 You, radio winner. What\u2019s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. \u2013 In your sleep? \u2013 Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that\u2019s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn\u2019t pay enough attention to her and\u2026 and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I\u2019ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school\u2026 When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, \u201cAnthony, I\u2019m so proud of you. You\u2019re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?\u201d And I said, \u201cHonestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.\u201d Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, \u201cOkay, Anthony, I understand.\u201d Couple months go by. It\u2019s the end of summer. I\u2019m packing up my dad\u2019s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, \u201cAnthony, here, before you leave, take this.\u201d And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, \u201cThanks, Grandma, that\u2019s exactly what we talked about.\u201d I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I\u2019m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It\u2019s my grandma. \u201cAnthony, just calling to see how college is going.\u201d \u201cGrandma, college is the best. I\u2019m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I\u2019m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\u201d And I said, \u201cTotally, Grandma, I\u2019m on chapter four.\u201d She said, \u201cOkay, Anthony, I guess I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I\u2019m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, \u201cPlease, it\u2019s Anthony. I\u2019m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.\u201d She said, \u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?\u201d And I said, \u201cYes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!\u201d And she said, \u201cOkay, Anthony. I guess I\u2019ll talk to you later.\u201d Finally, it\u2019s the end of the school year. I\u2019ve got straight A\u2019s, but I\u2019m dropping out of college, \u2019cause I have no more money left. And I\u2019m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It\u2019s my grandma. \u201cAnthony, I heard you\u2019re dropping out of school today. How come?\u201d And I said, \u201cYou know goddamn well how come, Grandma! \u2018Cause you wouldn\u2019t give me any money.\u201d She said, \u201cAnthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?\u201d And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother\u2019s handwriting, it said, \u201cFuck you.\u201d Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they\u2019re all made up, they\u2019re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else\u2026 everything else is fake. But everything I\u2019m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that\u2019s all true. Now\u2026 I don\u2019t tell dark jokes because I\u2019m a comedian. I\u2019m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I\u2019m kind of fucked up, all right? I\u2019ve always been this way. I can\u2019t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It\u2019s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone\u2019s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, \u201cI\u2019ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?\u201d \u201cAnthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don\u2019t tell a joke. Try not to.\u201d So I walked up and was like, \u201cYou know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like\u2026 Mark Twain out of my grandma\u2019s mouth, it would just come to life.\u201d And then I couldn\u2019t help myself. I said, \u201cAnd I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the \u2018N\u2019 word.\u201d Now I promise you\u2026 I promise you\u2026 until you\u2019ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife\u2019s funeral\u2026 \u2026at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi\u2026 you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I\u2019m one of the best comedians of all time. But here\u2019s the thing. It doesn\u2019t matter if you believe me. It really doesn\u2019t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don\u2019t believe in too soon. I\u2019m on a tight schedule. And I\u2019m good at it. I\u2019m good at it. Like, the day of\u2026 the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted \u201cOther than that, how was the movie?\u201d Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that\u2026 the reason I get away with stuff like that is I\u2019m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn\u2019t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don\u2019t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, \u201cDon\u2019t do it.\u201d And whenever I see that\u2026 whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad \u2019cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, \u201cAnthony, what\u2019s funny about Aurora? What\u2019s funny about the Boston Marathon? What\u2019s funny about your grandmother\u2019s funeral?\u201d Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That\u2019s where I come in. So I see these texts and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, no, what happened?\u201d But I also think, \u201cI\u2019ve got a job to do.\u201d So I go online, I start reading about it. I don\u2019t want to watch the footage. But I\u2019ll read about what happened. And I think, \u201cHow can I make someone laugh today?\u201d And then I think, \u201cI got it.\u201d I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, \u201cGuys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.\u201d \u201cEspecially the finish line.\u201d And again, I think, \u201cNailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!\u201d But then my phone starts to ring. And it\u2019s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, \u201cAnthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You\u2019re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you\u2019re fired.\u201d And I say, \u201cGo fuck yourselves.\u201d And I meant it. I didn\u2019t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I\u2019m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said\u2026 Sure. They said, \u201cWell, Anthony, you don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t understand at all. If you don\u2019t take this joke down right now, if you don\u2019t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they\u2019re also out of a job.\u201d And I\u2019m ashamed to tell you this. I\u2019m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. \u2018Cause I\u2019m happy to fight for what I believe in. I\u2019m happy to take the consequences for what I\u2019ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, \u201cHey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.\u201d Couldn\u2019t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I\u2019ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I\u2019m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They\u2019re like, \u201cAnthony, we\u2019re family. Why are you so upset? Can\u2019t you see we did you a favor? Don\u2019t you worry about your career?\u201d Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they\u2019re worried about their money, they wouldn\u2019t have played the lottery in the first fuckin\u2019 place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, \u201cAnthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you\u2019re making fun of the victims, and that\u2019s wrong.\u201d But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I\u2019m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever\u2026 No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, \u201cHey, are we trending?\u201d No. This is who I\u2019m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: \u201cMy thoughts and prayers\u2026\u201d \u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.\u201d \u201cMy thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.\u201d Do you know what that\u2019s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, \u201cDon\u2019t forget about me today.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t forget about me.\u201d \u201cLots of crazy distractions in the news, but don\u2019t forget how sads I am.\u201d Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They\u2019re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I\u2019m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It\u2019s fine. It\u2019s embarrassing, but it\u2019s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It\u2019s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that\u2019s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that\u2019s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called \u201cShark Party.\u201d All right? Now\u2026 Some of you enjoyed it, but if you\u2019ve never seen \u201cShark Party,\u201d you can never see \u201cShark Party.\u201d It\u2019s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People\u2026 People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck, yeah.\u201d Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, \u201cYou know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there\u2019s a shark attack, we\u2019re having a shark party.\u201d And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I\u2019ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It\u2019s time for a shark party.\u201d Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I\u2019ve ever said on television: \u201cSmile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.\u201d And in America, where I\u2019m famous for those types of shenanigans\u2026 everybody was like, \u201cAnthony, that was fucked up.\u201d \u201cIt was fucked up to see you dance.\u201d End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don\u2019t get my show, they\u2019ve never seen me, and frankly, they don\u2019t get out much\u2026 the New Zealand media takes the video\u2026 and they show it to the guy\u2019s family. And they say, \u201cWhat do you guys think about this?\u201d And they say, \u201cCrikey,\u201d or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don\u2019t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.\u201d They say, \u201cYou are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of \u2018Shark Party.'\u201d And I was like, \u201cReally? New Zealand wants to kill me? That\u2019s weird because they didn\u2019t even kill the shark.\u201d I said, \u201cHow many death threats am I getting?\u201d And they were like \u201cOh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?\u201d I said, \u201cNo, forget about it. Leave it alone, don\u2019t worry.\u201d This might be hard for some to understand. I\u2019ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don\u2019t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I\u2019m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, \u201cCome on then.\u201d My security guys are like, \u201cOkay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d \u201cBut you\u2019re the boss. Okay.\u201d And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say \u201cAnthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn\u2019t care yesterday, but it\u2019s gotten much worse. You\u2019re gonna wanna hear this.\u201d They say, \u201cSomeone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad\u2019s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online\u2026 and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.\u201d And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind\u2026 that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm\u2019s way, for something I\u2019ve done or I\u2019ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I\u2019ve made? Even better.","bill":"[cheers and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. How are you? What\u2019s going on? Thank you. It\u2019s a pleasure to be here in the greater Atlanta, Georgia, area, this oasis. It\u2019s nice to be here. I don\u2019t know why I came here in June. It\u2019s nice to be here. Wasn\u2019t thinking. Fucking ridiculously hot out there. Just miserable, horrible. That kind of heat, you understand the racism down here, ya know? I get it. How would you get along with anybody? \u201cLook at \u2019em just over there, drinkin\u2019 a cold drink! Lemonade was made for the white man!\u201d So\u2026 What the hell have I been doing with my life? Trying to get in shape, man. But I hate going to the gym, so I decided I\u2019d go veggie twice a week. It\u2019s brutal. I can only make it till about 5:00. Five o\u2019clock, that\u2019s what I realized about myself, you know that? Something has to die every day in order for me to live. Something\u2019s got to get its beak chopped off, its feathers yanked, uppercut to its jaw, just in order for me to survive. I\u2019m trying! Couscous and all that shit. It\u2019s awful. I saw this thing, though. They said if everybody went vegan, if everybody went vegan or vegetarian, whatever the hell they said. One of those \u201cV\u201d ones, right? They said it\u2019ll be great for the environment, you know. I guess there\u2019s all this cattle standing around, and when they fart, the gas goes up in the atmosphere and causes something. Right? They\u2019re always doing that shit. You know, \u201cIf everybody went vegan, the air would be\u2013 If everybody drove an electric car, if everybody just had some snowshoes on.\u201d Right? They just won\u2019t come out and say it. Nobody has the balls to come out and just say, \u201cLook, 85% of you have to go.\u201d \u2013 That\u2019s it! That is it. \u2013 [cheering and applause] I have been bitching about the population problem for three specials in a row. Waiting\u2026 for some politician to have the balls to bring it up, but they won\u2019t do it, they won\u2019t do it. We live in a democracy. Right? Can\u2019t be honest in a democracy. You need the votes. You can\u2019t run with that as your platform. Coming out there: \u201cAnd if elected, I would implement a program to immediately eliminate at least 85% of you! This planet cannot sustain the sheer numbers\u2013 Let me finish! This will not be arbitrary. Under your seats is a multiple choice questionnaire! If you did not bring a pencil, you\u2019re already out!\u201d You can\u2019t do that. You got to be nice. You got to be fuckin\u2019 nice, especially this day and age. Everybody getting in trouble, all these goddamn groups out there, bitch, moaning and complaining anytime anybody says anything. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a group, eh.\u201d You gotta apologize. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to people who own Shar Peis. I didn\u2019t mean to say that it\u2019s an ugly-ass dog, nah.\u201d Right? Fuck you and your group. What about that? What do you got, two million people in your group? There\u2019s 400 million in this country. Nobody gives a shit. Right? Who the fuck joins a group? \u201cI\u2019m gonna join a group, that\u2019s what I\u2019m gonna do today.\u201d Go to meetings. What kind of a fucking loser, right? That\u2019s the same way I look at people who got upset about, you know, Michael Sam, the gay football player kissing his boyfriend when he got drafted. Everybody bitch, moaning and complaining. It\u2019s like, dude, that\u2019s what you get for watching the draft, all right? Now once again, what kind of a fucking loser just sits there watching round after round? \u201cThe Jets are up next. I think they need a quarterback. They need to improve their defensive line.\u201d Dude, that\u2019s like going to a graduation ceremony where you don\u2019t know anybody who\u2019s graduating. You\u2019re just fucking sitting there. They\u2019re gonna have the whole list the next day. They\u2019ll have everybody. Who drafted who, when. Fucking got to sit there and watch that shit. Those stupid interviews. \u201cYeah, you\u2019re a member of the Buffalo Bills. How does it feel?\u201d \u201cWell, you know, it\u2019s a blessing. I want to thank God. Gonna try to do my best, it\u2019s a great organization, and the same shit the last 80 guys said. So, yeah.\u201d Yeah. I\u2019m glad he kissed him. He should have fuckin\u2019 blown him. Yeah! With birthday cake in his mouth and a Santa Claus hat on his head, just to ruin the entire year. Holding a flag. That fucks up Flag Day. You\u2019ll keep thinking about it. Yeah. Fucking stupid-ass groups. People apologizing to \u2019em like they have some sort of power. Look, if you\u2019re being a dick, apologize. But other than that, yeah, go fuck yourself. Yeah. [cheers and applause] Everybody getting in trouble, like a bunch of children. I was doing a gig in Dallas, and some waitress wrote on a piece of chalkboard. She goes, \u201cWe like our beer the way we like our violence, domestic.\u201d Right? Now I got to tell you something. That\u2019s a great fucking joke! There is zero fat on that. You need every word of that joke. You take one word out, it doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s a perfect joke. So whatever, nobody gives a shit. One person comes in, they don\u2019t like it, they ask the manager to take it down. He\u2019s just like, \u201cThat\u2019s our sense of humor here. Have a beer, go fuck yourself. That\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.\u201d She takes a picture of it, puts it on Facebook. All of a sudden, people start complaining. They fired the manager and the waitress. Because of that. Yeah! I don\u2019t understand, like, what do they think is gonna happen if somebody reads that joke? Like, you\u2019re some guy who would never hit a woman, ya know. Would never hit a woman. You can\u2019t hit women. You honestly cannot. You ever see how they fall? They fall like toddlers, you know? It\u2019s like they never fell in their life. They never put their hands out. It\u2019s horrific to watch. You can\u2019t hit them. Right? So what are you telling me? Somebody\u2026 you\u2019re telling me someone who never hit a woman is gonna come walking in, read that joke, you know, just be, \u201cWait a minute!\u201d [shouts angrily] That\u2019s the dumbest shit. They have all kinds of signs out there telling people not to hit women, people still do it. What do you think wife beaters are doing when they drive home? They\u2019re like so focused on hitting their wife, they got blinders on, they\u2019re not reading anything? They don\u2019t see the \u201cDon\u2019t Hit Your Wife\u201d billboard? They\u2019re still gonna do it. Did that get too weird for you guys? Did the church organs make that fucked up like I was up here? \u201cMake a pledge for Jesus and hit your women.\u201d Ever watch some of those stupid religious shows? That fucking Joel Osteen, you ever see that guy? That guy is so full of shit, he doesn\u2019t even open his eyes when he\u2019s talking. \u201cTake a pledge for Jesus. Are they still here?\u201d He doesn\u2019t even have the nerve to open his eyes. \u201cYou want some popsicles? Jesus wants you to have some popsicles. He wants you to have those popsicles.\u201d His fucking electric blue carpet. Yeah, everybody\u2019s getting in trouble \u2019cause of these goddamn groups. Look at the amount of old people that got in trouble this year. Old people get in trouble, right? That older woman there that makes the cookies on the Food Network, right? Yeah, Paula Deen. She got in trouble, \u2019cause she had this slavery-themed wedding or whatever the hell she did. In defense of her, you know, you want to have an original wedding. There\u2019s not a lot of themes left, you know? You got to use the old imagination if you\u2019re gonna try to blow people away with your creativity, right? I\u2019m actually gonna have a Holocaust- themed pool party later on this summer. I am. \u201cOnce everyone gets in ze pool, ja.\u201d \u201cIt was weird, it was like it was offensive but like refreshing, you know? I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know how I feel about it.\u201d Yeah, she got in trouble. The old redneck on Duck Dynasty, that dude got in trouble. The owner of the Clippers got in trouble. And I\u2019m not saying what these people did wasn\u2019t offensive. I\u2019m not sayin\u2019 that shit. What pissed me off was at no point during all of these stories did anybody address their age, you know? They\u2019re fucking old, you know? What did you think they thought? You never talked to a grandparent and asked the wrong question and all of a sudden, it went down this crazy road? \u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa! Let\u2019s get back to the cookies, Grandma! Let\u2019s leave that shit over here, what the fuck?\u201d Yeah, they\u2019re old. What did you think they thought? I mean\u2013 I\u2019m gonna be honest with you. People were too hard on that Clippers guy, man, I\u2019m telling you. For an 80-year-old white guy, that wasn\u2019t that bad. All right? Dude, he didn\u2019t drop the \u201cN\u201d word once. That\u2019s unbelievable for an 80-year-old white guy. The \u201cN\u201d word should have been carpet-bombed through that whole tape. He never said it once! If you go back and listen to that tape\u2013 go back and listen to it. Other than Instagram, he\u2019s pretty fucking liberal. He\u2019s like, \u201cYou can hang out with them, you can have sex with them, just don\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\u201d Yeah, it was the weirdest, most compartmentalized, like, racism I ever heard in my life. Something about Instagram, I didn\u2019t get it. Other than that, he was wide open. \u201cYou can make a snowman with them, go to a water park, rub your bellies together, just don\u2019t promote it on Instagram.\u201d \u201cHey, what about Facebook?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t give a fuck about Facebook! Keep it off of Instagram!\u201d Yeah. Dude, you understand, the guy is 80 years old. Do the math. This dude was born in 1934. That\u2019s 13 years before Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. First 12 and a half years of this guy\u2019s life, he watched all-white baseball, and it was fine! First 12 and a half years. \u201cUp next, Whitey Willoughby! There\u2019s a line shot out to Peter Peckerwood, what a catch! Unbelievable, in to Chris Cracker! What a great day. What a great day for a ballgame. White baseball, white players.\u201d Dude, his parents were part of the generation that finished off the genocide of the Native Americans, all right? That\u2019s who taught him his ABCs. You know? \u201c~ A, B, C, D, E\u2026 ~ Hey, get that savage off my property! Get out of here! I thought we killed all you people! Put a fence around them! ~ H, I, J, K\u2026 ~\u201d Yeah. What did you think was gonna happen? The owner of the Clippers, you know what his big crime was? He lived too long. He did. If he\u2019d died around 1969, 1970, nobody would have noticed. Dude, look at Walt Disney, Walt Disney was a known anti-Semite. But he died in the early \u201970s. Nobody gives a shit. Look at him, he\u2019s got a castle, bunch of mice running around. Nobody cares. This guy kept living. Telling you, you can live too long. You can live too long, I\u2019m telling you. You wear out your welcome. I swear to God, this fucking guy, I bet in the 1940\u2019s, he was considered a hippie. You know? Just walking around, \u201cHey, you can hang out with \u2019em, you can have sex with \u2019em, man, you know?\u201d His dad\u2019s getting all pissed off: \u201cLet me tell you something, see? You stay with your own! You stay with your own.\u201d That\u2019s true, though. Life can pass you by. It happens. You just keep living and living. Basically, I think you got, like, 25, 30 years to absorb as much as you can, and then that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all you know. \u2018Cause right around then, you get married, and it\u2019s over, right? You have a couple of kids, you\u2019re sucked in the bubble. You don\u2019t have time to pay attention to what\u2019s going on out in the world. You\u2019re stuck with these kids. \u201cIt\u2019s shitting all over the place! Don\u2019t be a serial killer! Don\u2019t touch that!\u201d You\u2019re just stuck in that. You have three, four kids, that is a 25-year sentence, trying to get them all through college. Society just keeps fucking going. You get the last one through college, step back out of the bubble\u2013 You don\u2019t know what happened. You\u2019re not even paying attention. You go back to your old record collection. [scatting] Someone sticks a mike in your face, you\u2019re gonna get in trouble. Yeah. It\u2019s one of the sad things about life. You get old and it passes you by. I feel it passing me by. I\u2019m 46 years old. I don\u2019t even have kids, but I can\u2019t keep up anymore. I had a college gig coming up, I was like, I gotta figure out what these kids are into. I was 24 when a senior was born. I got to figure out what these dudes are into, so I guess they\u2019re into like, this like DJ music or some shit, so I\u2019m like, all right, I\u2019ll watch some of this. You know? So I have like a reference or two. I don\u2019t want to be that old comic coming to the gig being like, \u201cWhat\u2019s up with this Monica Lewinsky? Is this crazy? I mean, this Y2K\u2013 Is my stylus gonna work? I don\u2019t know.\u201d So I put this shit on. Dude, I lasted 90 seconds. Ninety seconds. I was open-minded. \u201cAll right, put it on!\u201d Ninety seconds later, I\u2019m like this old man. \u201cAh, this isn\u2019t music!\u201d You know? \u201cWhen I was a kid, you dressed like a woman and you sung about the devil. Now, that was music! And you had one ballad every album, started off in black and white and when the guitar solo came in, it went to color. Yeah, that was music.\u201d Yeah. All of this shit\u2019s passing me by. I\u2019ll get in trouble later on in my life. Transgender athletes? I don\u2019t fucking understand that, you know? I understand, you want to switch around, I don\u2019t give a shit, but I\u2019m a sports fan. That\u2019s a really new concept to me, that you can be a dude, right? Ranked 80th in the fucking world. You have your dick cut off, you put on a sports bra, and now you\u2019re the #1 tennis player in the world, just coming out there with your man shoulders. [grunting] That doesn\u2019t seem fair. I might be wrong. I might just be an old guy, I have no idea. But I\u2019m hearing rumors like some of them are getting into that MMA. You can\u2019t have that shit. Am I nuts? That is a dickless dude beating the shit out of a woman. Jesus Christ! He might as well hit her with his discarded dick like a flashlight. \u201cHold still!\u201d \u201cHer ground and pound is incredible.\u201d Yeah. I\u2019m not saying these people are right, and I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019m right. I know I\u2019m a fucking moron, ya know. But that Duck Dynasty guy\u2013 I know what he said was wrong, but I don\u2019t get the shock. Said that homophobic stuff, and people are like, \u201cCan you believe?\u201d Yeah, I totally can believe it. If I was in Vegas, I would have put 90% of my shit on that he was gonna say it. I\u2019d give him a 10% benefit of the doubt just in case. Are you seriously shocked some redneck with a beard down to his dick sitting in a boat in the middle of a swamp shooting varmints? Like, what did you think he thought? Did you think he had some progressive ideas on same-sex marriage? [cheers and applause] Yeah. Didn\u2019t he think\u2026 Didn\u2019t he think exactly what you thought\u2026 he thought, you know? You know what kills me too? That fuckin\u2019 kinda shit, that homophobic stuff, that all comes from the church, man. Doesn\u2019t it come from that shit? There\u2019s something in there. I never read the Book, all right? I tried to. They need to fucking update it. They update iTunes every fuckin\u2019 six days. Can we update the language and make it a little more user friendlieth\u2026 for someone like me? Right? That\u2019s where he gets all those fucking ideas. That Duck Dynasty guy, it\u2019s not his fault that he went to\u2013 He went to Sunday School in like 1949, you know? I think all of that shit comes from the church. They just fuckin\u2019 brainwash you. You know? Don\u2019t clap, don\u2019t clap, I don\u2019t read, I don\u2019t read. Follow someone else. I\u2019m telling you, they brainwash you. Come into the church, your brain\u2019s all empty, they fill it like a jelly donut. [making squishing sounds] Just brainwash you. \u201c~ Say what we say when we say it ~ ~ Say it again, then you can go home to your toys ~\u201d \u201c~ All right, I\u2019ll say it ~ ~ I\u2019ll say it again ~ ~ Now can I go home to my toys? ~\u201d Right? And you repeat everything they say. The good, the bad, and the fucking horrific. They stick a star on your forehead. \u201cYou\u2019re a big boy.\u201d \u201cLooks like people like me!\u201d You get on with your life. You go to college, you get a master\u2019s degree in English like this redneck dude had, he invents the new duck whistle or whatever the hell you call it, right. Yours goes, \u201cWhack whack!\u201d Mine goes, \u201cWhack-a-fuckin\u2019-whack!\u201d Dude makes a zillion bucks, gets his own TV show, he\u2019s loving life. And out of nowhere, here comes that same question sixty years later from Sunday School, and he stands up like the Manchurian Candidate. \u201cJesus liked hookers and lepers, doesn\u2019t like the queers.\u201d And everybody freaks the fuck out, and he\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s what they said!\u201d And they\u2019re all dead. \u201cOh, where\u2019d everybody go? I thought I was a good boy!\u201d He\u2019s just this scared old man getting yelled at in a boat. I don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand why a group like GLAAD, right? I always forget, it\u2019s Gay Lesbian A\u2026 whatever the fuck it stands for, all right? Why do they go after the old guy in the boat? Why don\u2019t they go after the people writing the Book? Right? \u201cHey, could you please teareth outeth those coupleth of pages?\u201d They\u2019re not gonna do that. That\u2019s the Vatican. They\u2019re their own city. They got a wall around their own city. They\u2019re brushing off cases of pedophilia like it\u2019s nothing. They\u2019re not taking that call. \u201cOh, what happened? Really? Go fuck yourself.\u201d Click. They don\u2019t care. [applause] I learned a long time ago, I think whatever you\u2019re into, you\u2019re into, but I\u2019m not into that religious stuff where\u2013 And this is why. I actually walked away from my religion. I had to be honest with myself. One, I didn\u2019t like to go\u2013 I didn\u2019t like going to church every week, you know? I just didn\u2019t. Part of it was I\u2019m lazy. I don\u2019t like getting up on Sundays, and the other part was I already heard all the stories, okay? Heard them three, four times, the Dude hasn\u2019t come back yet. You know, we\u2019re just sort of mulching over the same shit here, I got it. \u2013 Right? \u2013 [cheers and applause] And the other aspect was, you know, I actually\u2013 I had to be honest with myself. I felt my religion made sense and everybody else\u2019s sounded stupid. [cackles] I did. Look, I\u2019m not talking about the basis of every religion. Basis of every religion makes sense, you know, the Ten Commandments. Don\u2019t kill anybody. Don\u2019t touch my wife. That\u2019s my bike. Right? That all makes sense. Of which, I\u2019ve broken, I think I\u2019ve broken just about every commandment except for the fifth one, that\u2019s it. I haven\u2019t killed anybody yet, right? But the murderous thoughts that I have sometimes, I think I could do it. Like when someone gets on a plane and they kick off their loafers, and they\u2019re wearing those gold-toed, like, dress socks, and they cross their feet at the ankles, and they just start rubbing their feet together. Like, I see the whole thing, see the whole thing. Wrapping that sock. Shh\u2026 Shh\u2026 Shh\u2026 Right? See the whole thing, so we\u2019ll see. Still early on, right? But just the stories of how we got here, and where we\u2019re going, and what happens after we die, everybody else\u2019s religion sounded stupid, you know? Like, I live out in Los Angeles, there\u2019s a bunch of Scientologists out there, and the first time I heard the story of Scientology, I was like, \u201cThat is the dumbest shit I have ever heard in my life.\u201d [man] Yeah! Like, your guy\u2019s name is Ron? Ron! And he wasn\u2019t alive thousands of years ago, so you can hide a lot of it in the mystery. This guy was alive, like, 45, 50 years ago. He had a driver\u2019s license, Social Security number. There\u2019s like footage of him stubbing his toe. \u201cMotherfucker!\u201d Right? I know what happened. He was working at Denny\u2019s, he got sick of it. \u201cI\u2019ll start a religion. Hey, everybody, there\u2019s this spaceship coming back. Everybody\u2019s getting sneakers. This is Tom Cruise. We\u2019re gonna try to make you clear, right?\u201d Look, I\u2019m paraphrasing, I\u2019m paraphrasing. To be fair to the Scientologists, I am paraphrasing, but that\u2019s essentially what they believe in. And I said that is the dumbest shit I ever heard while simultaneously still kind of believing that a woman who never got fucked had a baby that walked on water, died, and came back three days later. So\u2026 Yeah. That made total sense to me. So it just hit me one day, I was like, why does that make sense and that shit doesn\u2019t, you know? They got a spaceship in theirs, you know? We\u2013 right? We got the space shuttle, you know? There\u2019s sneakers. There\u2019s a lot of shit I can relate to in this. Why does that sound so dumb to me? You know what it is? I think it\u2019s \u2019cause I heard their story when I was an adult. I heard my story when I was four years old, right? When I heard my story, there was still some fat fuck coming down the chimney, giving me Christmas toys. If I lost a tooth, there was a fairy. There was the Easter Bunny. Why wouldn\u2019t there be some bearded baby moonwalking across the lake? Throwing out bottomless buckets of shrimp or whatever He did? Of course that made sense. What happened was, as I got older, all of that stuff started to fall, right? \u201cAh, son, there is no fat fuck, it\u2019s your mother and I. Your mom\u2019s the Tooth Fairy, rabbits don\u2019t have eggs, her tits are fake, the NBA is fixed! Bankers are cunts! Most of your dreams won\u2019t come true!\u201d Right? And I was just like, \u201cWow, this is how the world is.\u201d And meanwhile this shit was just floating, this 800-pound gorilla of this fucking story. I just had to make a decision, what am I gonna do? What am I gonna do with this? Am I gonna cling to it, be that person? \u201cThat\u2019s very offensive to me and other Christians and\u2026\u201d Become that douche? All right? And be like the casual Christian, right, with, like, one foot on base, just, \u201cYeah, I kind of go, a couple of times a year, and, like, if my parents come to town, I act like I go all the time, and I don\u2019t go anymore.\u201d Or my last option, which was basically just, just let go of the shit, you know? Just let go. [cheers and applause] Just let go of it like that creepy moment in curling. You know. That moment where the shooter, or whatever you call them, is just sliding with that rock, right? Just let me do this right, just sliding. And you think he\u2019s along for the ride, the two of them, they\u2019re a team, and all of a sudden out of nowhere he just goes fucking\u2026 That rock just keeps going, this dude just stops. That\u2019s what I did with my religion. I just let go of it. I didn\u2019t read a riot act to anybody, I just let go of it. \u201cAnd on the third day, He rose again in fulfillment of the Scriptures\u2026\u201d I just floated away. [cheers and applause] So now it\u2019s like, I\u2019m in this weird place where I\u2019m not in any religion right now. Unrestricted free agent. You know? [cackles] I\u2019d like to believe in something, so I\u2019ve been going around asking people what their shit is, and I haven\u2019t been able to find anything. Trying to be open-minded. I was doing a gig in Helsinki, and over there, they\u2019re, like, Lutheran, and what they believe, they believe when you die, you\u2019re dead and that\u2019s it. Dead, like a pigeon, just\u2013 just layin\u2019 there. Over. Blew my mind, I\u2019m like, \u201cReally? You\u2019re just dead?\u201d Like my religion was you die, and then you go up to get judged, right? God pops in the DVD of your life. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about this right here. Mind explaining yourself?\u201d This might be the most arrogant thing I say all night, but I actually resent the fact that I\u2019m gonna get judged someday. Like, if that\u2019s true, that somebody\u2019s gonna judge me, that doesn\u2019t even make any sense. It\u2019s like, Dude, you made me, so this is your fuck-up. All right? Let\u2019s not try to turn this around on me. You know? Jesus Christ. You give me freedom of choice, you make whores, you have me suck at math, and you don\u2019t think this thing\u2019s gonna go off the rails? Like, you set me up to fail, and now you got the balls to now question\u2026 your own goddamn work. Dude, if I made a car, if I built a car and it didn\u2019t run, I wouldn\u2019t burn it forever. \u201cYou evil piece of shit!\u201d Just light it on fire. I wouldn\u2019t, I would troubleshoot. Is there gas in the engine? Is the battery charged? \u201cAnything beyond this, I got to get a real man to look at it, but I believe in you. I\u2019m gonna try and help you out.\u201d Yes, my religion, it\u2019s nuts. It\u2019s fucking nuts. Like, my religion, like, the way I was brought up is like, you know, you can make it to heaven but, like, some of your family members possibly couldn\u2019t, or some of your friends. Doesn\u2019t even make sense. Like how am I supposed to enjoy heaven if that\u2019s the deal, right? Just sitting here, waiting for my friends to show up, \u201cJesus Christ, where the hell are they? It\u2019s been, like, 150 years! They must have ate a lot of Brussels sprouts or some shit! Doing some yoga, right?\u201d And then one day, it just settles in that they didn\u2019t make it. And then what, I\u2019m still gonna enjoy heaven, right? Jesus coming walking over: \u201cHey, how is it going, everybody? Isn\u2019t this great? Isn\u2019t this great?\u201d \u201cYeah, Dude, it\u2019d be even better if all my family members and friends weren\u2019t burning for fucking ever! Kind of hard to enjoy heaven when you just keep thinking of that there, J-star, what do you think? Hey, Dude, I didn\u2019t ask you to come over. You came walking over with your big, dumb sandals. \u2018Hey, hey, how is it going over here?\u2019 Why did you come over here? I don\u2019t give a damn. Dude, tell your dad. I don\u2019t give a fuck! I\u2019m already in here, I\u2019m already in here. What, are you gonna kick me out afterwards? Go fuck yourself. I knew He was gonna be like that, I knew it. The boss\u2019s son is the worst. Fucking sense of entitlement.\u201d So yeah, so they believe when you die, you\u2019re dead. And I was like, so you\u2019re just dead. Like, how do you wrap your head around not existing? I couldn\u2019t get my head around it. He goes, \u201cWell, like before, when you were born, do you remember that?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo,\u201d and the guy\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, it\u2019s just like that.\u201d I\u2019m like, not only does that make sense, that is absolutely terrifying. Dude, I got to be honest, I hate how scared I\u2019m getting as I get older. I\u2019m developing all these new fears. Like, I have a fear of flying now. I never had a fear of it. It\u2019s not straight-across-the-board flying. I don\u2019t like small planes all of a sudden. I just don\u2019t like them, and it has nothing to do with the plane. I believe in the planes, okay? I just don\u2019t believe in the pilots. \u2018Cause you know what? I don\u2019t think the airline does, either. Which is why that dude is flying that little plane. The airline was basically, like, \u201cAll right, we\u2019ll give you, like, 28 people. See how you do, you know? You fly them up, you land, you bring another 28 back. We\u2019ll let you do this for a while. You do this for a while, we don\u2019t get any complaints, no up and down, up and down, none of that shit, we\u2019ll move you up to 35 people. And then one day, you\u2019ll be in a jet\u2013\u201d Whoo! We\u2019re going a little faster. Right? Big planes, you\u2019re getting the fuckin\u2019 pilot that knows what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s probably fought in a war. He\u2019s used to getting shot at. He can\u2019t bring this bus in? It\u2019s a joke. Right? A bunch of people whining in the back, \u201cMy headphones don\u2019t work!\u201d He doesn\u2019t give a fuck, right? He\u2019s up there sleeping. He\u2019s trying to make something happen, he\u2019s so goddamn bored. That\u2019s a stud up there, right? So one time I\u2019m flying into Albany, New York, okay, a city that nobody really goes to. So I\u2019m on a smaller plane, and everything is going great. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, we hit this turbulence. [imitating sounds of turbulence] And it stops, and everybody looks around laughing nervously, like\u2026 [nervous laughter] All of a sudden, it comes back with a vengeance. You can literally hear the metal the plane\u2019s made of, like\u2026 All of a sudden, this dude three rows back starts making these bitchy noises. \u201cWhoa! Whaaa! Whoa! Whaaaa! Whoa!\u201d I\u2019m not gonna lie, I have never been so fucking scared in my entire life. Dude, that noise is acceptable out of a female or a child. But turn around and see a 37-year-old mustachioed male going\u2026 \u201cWhoo! Whaaa! Whoa!\u201d Dude, the hair was standing up on my arms. I\u2019m praying to a higher power, I don\u2019t even believe in the shit! I just wish I had the balls to turn around and be like, \u201cDude, would you shut the fuck up? Jesus Christ, be a man, push it down. Push it down, deny your feelings, act like you have answers. Do some man shit right now. Do some man shit.\u201d Jesus Christ. You know? \u201cYou think I\u2019m not up here thinking\u2026 \u2018Whaaa! Whoa!\u2019 I am! But how does that help us for me to join you and turn this fuselage into a haunted house?\u201d You know what kills me, what absolutely kills me, is some woman is gonna fall in love with this guy, marry him and make half\u2026 whooo\u2026 whaaaa\u2026 fucking kids. And you know what? We become weaker as a species. We do. [cheers and applause] Do you remember back in the day when you watched the Discovery Channel about animals? Now they build cars, but it used to be about animals, right? Now it\u2019s all car stuff. \u201cLooking forward to getting that carburetor today. The carburetor didn\u2019t fit.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean the carburetor doesn\u2019t fit? Dad\u2019s gonna be mad.\u201d [yelling gibberish] There\u2019s never enough time to build the car. It\u2019s so fucking stupid. \u201cWe got to have this bus done by Thursday!\u201d Or else what? The guy doesn\u2019t want it anymore? All right. \u201cYou\u2019ll get the thing when we finish it, okay? This is a safety issue. You want brakes on it? Then go get yourself some fucking lunch.\u201d So, before\u2026 [laughter] before there used to just be animals, and this is what I noticed: Everything from a lion all the way down to an insect, okay? If you had one drop of\u2026 whoo\u2026 whaaa\u2026 bitchy blood in you, none of the females would fuck you. That was it, your life was over. Your life was over. No ant pussy for you your entire miserable eight-day ant life, \u2019cause all six of your legs shook when the wind blew, and the female ant saw it. They\u2019re like, \u201cAll right, stay away from that one. Stay away from that one. He\u2019s gonna jeopardize the whole hill. And, Stacy, listen to me.\u201d Human beings have empathy. Some woman will fall in love. \u201cWell, he\u2019s nice. He wears a sweater. He likes to bake, you know? He lets me finish my stories.\u201d Which is all great qualities, okay, but you got to know, when you shack up with a guy like that, you\u2019re rolling the dice. You\u2019re rolling the dice that that fucking axe murderer is gonna pick the next house over, \u2019cause God forbid he picks your goddamn house, this is the dude who has your back, who\u2019s gonna be screaming louder and higher than you when this guy comes through the fucking door. And you\u2019re gonna turn around. All you\u2019re gonna see is his cowardly feet going out the kitchen window. I don\u2019t know, man, that\u2019s risky. You know, in reality, I\u2019m being too hard on that guy. Yeah, I am. I am, \u2019cause I was just as scared as he was. Except I didn\u2019t scream out like he did, and that\u2019s simple. The simple reason was this dude, he was hugged too much as a child. Having people going, \u201cHow was your day? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d And all of that shit, you know? That\u2019s why I came down here. I came out here to tell you guys, you got to stop hugging your children. You are ruining this country. Now you can hug your daughters, you got to do that, you got to do that. Hug those hooker shoes right out of them, let them know that you\u2019re a good man, and to find another man like you. You got to do that. But your son, you can hug them a little bit, but every three, four, you got to fucking knock \u2019em down, right? \u201cCome on, it didn\u2019t hurt, get up!\u201d I didn\u2019t come from a family, I don\u2019t know about you guys, I didn\u2019t come from a touchy-feely\u2026 \u201cCall me when you get there. Mwah, mwah.\u201d None of that shit. First time my mom hugged me, I think, was like, once when I was little, and when I moved out. That was it! And we only hugged \u2019cause we knew we were supposed to. So we just tried to, like, it was like two parking meters came to life, like, we almost bumped heads. It was horrific. Fucking horrific. To this day, sometimes I drive down the street, and I think about that hug, and it\u2019s just so awful I have to like shout the memory out of my head. I\u2019ll just be driving down the street, just be like\u2026 Aaaaah! Anybody else like that? You ever have to shout stuff out of your head? There\u2019s something about me, like, all my regret comes up when I\u2019m in the shower. I don\u2019t know what it is. I think \u2019cause I\u2019m in the shower, and I have time to think, and I\u2019ll just think of shit I did in third grade where I just made an ass of myself, and I\u2019ll just be in the shower just being like\u2026 [screaming] And my wife\u2019s always just like, \u201cIs everything okay in there?\u201d I\u2019ll just be like, \u201cYeah, yeah, just accidentally turned on the hot water. Turned it on too much.\u201d \u201cEvery day?\u201d So\u2026 Yeah\u2026 I actually asked my mother one time when I finally got out in the world, and I saw how other families interacted, I finally asked her, \u201cHow come we never did the hugging thing? How come we didn\u2019t do that stuff?\u201d She was like, \u201cI wanted to hug you kids when you were little, but I was afraid it was gonna make you gay.\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou were afraid?\u201d And she goes, \u201cWell, it was your father. That\u2019s what it was. Protecting him like I always do. He was afraid. He said, you don\u2019t know how to raise boys and if you hug them, that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen. So in a marriage, there\u2019s compromises.\u201d Yeah, so she basically never hugged us, \u2019cause my dad said if she did, it was gonna make us gay. And I got to tell you, that was a great thing that my dad did for me. Let me finish before you start blogging, okay? And I end up on a split screen on Good Morning Atlanta. \u201cComedy, could it go too far? Last night at the Tabernacle\u2013\u201d Sitting there next to some fucking Cheeto-eating blogger. So, yeah, this is the deal. I\u2019m gonna defend my dad here because this is basically what happens when you have a kid. As far as I know. I don\u2019t have any kids. As far as I\u2019d think, if you have a kid, what do you want to do? You want to improve on your childhood, okay? You want to keep the shit that your parents did that worked, and then you want to get rid of the stuff that didn\u2019t work. So that was my dad, as fucked up as that was, that was his improvement on his childhood that he never talks about, the way a veteran doesn\u2019t talk about going to war. So I figure if that was his improvement on his childhood, his childhood just must have been something like, \u201cDon\u2019t change his shitty diaper. Let him figure it out for himself. Get out in the rain, you shitty baby! Hey, let me handle this, lady! Why are you still standing here, you shit toddler?\u201d So he took it from that\u2026 and knocked it down to, \u201cDon\u2019t hug him, it\u2019s gonna make him gay.\u201d Right? And then maybe someday I ever have a kid, I\u2019ll whittle it down to like, \u201cHe\u2019s not taking drama class, all right? He\u2019s not taking drama class \u2019cause I said so, lady! Let me handle this!\u201d I won\u2019t fix everything. And that\u2019s not a homophobic thing either, that I wouldn\u2019t send my hypothetical son to drama class. Okay? It isn\u2019t. I would send\u2026 I\u2019d let my hypothetical daughter take a drama class. Okay. My son can\u2019t fucking do any of that shit unless I\u2019m sending him to one of those Fame high schools where everybody\u2019s doing it, one of those creative schools. You go to the cafeteria, everybody\u2019s like, ~ Cottage cheese, what is it made of? ~ Then he can do all he wants. Then he can do all the fuck he wants, but there\u2019s no way I\u2019m letting him do that at a public school with those goddamn animals! He\u2019s gonna get the shit kicked out of him! He\u2019s gonna come home with his underwear up his ass, and then I have to be the adult and go down to the principal and be like, \u201cThere\u2019s some sort of tomfoolery going on around here!\u201d I don\u2019t want to do that. I want to find the fucking eight-year-old. What is he, this tall? I want to find the kid that did it to my kid, tip him upside down into some sand or a puddle, anywhere where oxygen is going to be an issue, right, and just leave him there. You wait for that one leg to start shaking so you know he\u2019s down to his last breath, and then you turn him upside-right, and you grab him by his throat, you say something horrific. \u201cYou ever do that again, I\u2019m gonna beat your mother to death with the family dog.\u201d All right? [applause] Over. So yeah, a lot in my life has changed since I last came through here to Atlanta. I got married. That\u2019s the big thing. Yes, I did. Very happy about that. I\u2019m very happy because it was starting to get weird. It\u2019s like 45 years old. \u201cMy girlfriend, yeah, we\u2019re gonna go out and get some pop.\u201d Going to parties, it was just weird. \u2018Cause I hang out with people my age, and they all got married, they all had kids. I just couldn\u2019t contribute when people were standing around talking about marriage\u2026 marriages and kids. I felt like a little kid, just sitting there going like, \u201cThe superintendent of the mayoral candidate will be bicoastal, bipartisan, with the Middle Eastern crisis, it\u2019s just\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s an advanced learning program. The deadline is May 11th. We have to stop the bullying\u2026\u201d \u201c\u2026with the superintendent of the mayoral candidate.\u201d When the conversation would come around to me, I felt like I was eight years old. I\u2019d just be like, \u201cDid anybody see the YouTube video where the raccoon stole the cat\u2019s food, and the cat was scratching him and the raccoon didn\u2019t care? He just came in like this, like George Foreman, and then he reached out, he had hands. All of a sudden, he had hands. I didn\u2019t know they had hands. He scooped it up and he ran away on paws. Did you guys know they had hands?\u201d So now I\u2019m married, so the next move is you\u2019re supposed to have a kid, which I would love to do, but I\u2019m 46 years old. I\u2019m just thinking it\u2019s too fucking late, ya know. Come on, man, I\u2019m gonna have a kid, I\u2019m gonna die of natural causes when the kid\u2019s in fifth grade. Throwing him a Frisbee. \u201cWe used to use these on a Saturday.\u201d Do a face plant. My kid\u2019s standing there, \u201cMom, Dad\u2019s sleeping again!\u201d I feel hopelessly behind. All my friends have kids. Most of my friends who have kids are cool, but I got a couple of those who think now that they have a kid, that I don\u2019t understand anything anymore. You know those people? The most basic shit. \u201cHey, man, it\u2019s kind of cold out today.\u201d \u201cDude, you don\u2019t understand. You don\u2019t understand cold till you got a two-year-old with a mitten up his ass and you\u2019re trying to get chocolate off the other one\u2019s face.\u201d \u201cAll right, all right, I get it, you have a more complex life, but I still understand being cold, teeth chattering. Kind of lets me know. Right?\u201d \u201cMine just turned six.\u201d \u201cMine just turned seven.\u201d I just feel hopelessly behind. So what I\u2019m actually thinking of doing, I\u2019m thinking about adopting. Yeah. Absolutely, recycle. You know? Think globally, act locally. Everything doesn\u2019t have to be brand-new. You know? It\u2019s like when you redo your kitchen. You got custom up top, you got IKEA down the bottom, right? I\u2019d love to adopt. It\u2019s a great thing to do. But if I do it, I\u2019m not telling any of my friends. I\u2019m just gonna show up with the kid one day, just to piss \u2019em off. \u201cMine just turned six.\u201d \u201cMine just turned seven.\u201d I\u2019d love to just show up with an eight-year-old, like, \u201cDominoes! Yeah, now I get to tell you what you don\u2019t understand. Seven-year-old? Wait till they turn eight, eight is such a funny age. Terrible twos? Try the instant eights! Bam! They\u2019re just there, like\u2026! With all their issues\u2026!\u201d I should do it, though. I should adopt. I think it\u2019s a great thing to do, and I already know what I want to get. I do. I want to get, like, an \u201907, \u201908\u2026 always garaged, good dentition. Do you know what I would love to do? I\u2019d love to rescue some kid that works in a sweatshop. Wouldn\u2019t that be amazing? Like, find the kid that made this shirt? Just show up at the factory like, hey! \u201cCome on, bring it in! Bring it in, you little maniac! How you doing? You\u2019re going back to the States. L-shaped couch, flat screen TV. Get in the car, the rest of you keep sewing, but you, you\u2019re coming home with me!\u201d Yeah. Dude, how easy\u2026 how easy would that kid be to raise? After the hell he\u2019s been through, all I gotta do is let him sit down. I am immediately the greatest human being this kid has ever met. Just bring him home. \u201cHave a seat.\u201d He\u2019ll be like, \u201cI get to sit down?\u201d \u201cYeah, lay down on the couch.\u201d He\u2019ll be like, \u201cIt\u2019s like a cloud! It\u2019s like a cloud!\u201d I\u2019ll get him a bowl of Fritos, put on cricket or soccer, one of those sweatshop sports. I don\u2019t know. The kid would love me. So that\u2019s my first draft pick. All right? Coming out of the gate with that. In the second round, I\u2019d probably get like an \u201905 boy soldier, ya know. Yeah, shore up the offensive line. You gotta protect the blindside. That\u2019s how fucked up the world is, there\u2019s little boys out there fighting in wars. So that\u2019s a twofer. I can drag him out of that hell, give him something of what\u2019s left of his childhood, and, God forbid, if the dollar ever collapses, right? Shit goes south, zombies take over, I got backup. Everybody thinks I\u2019m gonna be the problem, meanwhile, I got this sawed-off Chuck Norris\u2026 standing next to me, 170 kills, confirmed fucking kills. They\u2019re not stories! Can make a flamethrower out of a vacuum cleaner and a toaster. You can\u2019t coach that, right? I got to be honest with you, I feel like I\u2019d have to go easier on the discipline with the boy solider. I might be nuts, but I feel like I could come down on the sweatshop kid, right? \u201cI said get in there and clean up your goddamn room. I\u2019m getting sick of this shit! Goes for you too if you want. But you! You\u2019ve been out of line all day, mister! Don\u2019t even start that shit! Don\u2019t even start that shit. You say that every time. Yes, you do. Every fucking time you say that. You know the answer. You want me to say it again? I\u2019ll break it down to you. You know why it is? You want to know why? \u2018Cause you sew. All right? Yeah. You sew. Dude, he\u2019s fucking killed people. Do you understand that? No, he doesn\u2019t, he doesn\u2019t have to make his bed too. No, he doesn\u2019t. Because he doesn\u2019t sleep in the bed, he\u2019s out in the bushes all night, talking to himself, freaking me the fuck out, all right? Oh, fuck you, fuck you! He scares me too, he scares me too. Don\u2019t even start that shit. You wanted a big brother, and I got you one. Don\u2019t even start that shit, all right? All right, you\u2019re right. Stop crying, stop crying. Shouldn\u2019t have yelled at you. I just thought I could fucking bring him in, give him a couple of Pop Tarts, I figured he\u2019d chill out. Fucking sitting there looking through his eyebrows, doing that Full Metal Jacket shit. No, you can\u2019t give him back, it doesn\u2019t work that way. There he is, there he is! What\u2019s up, buddy? What\u2019s going on? We were just talking about you, just doing, like, a little surprise thing. You feeling all right? You feeling all right? You\u2019re not looking through those eyebrows, huh? Everything okay?\u201d So I figure, uh\u2026 I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll do it. Maybe I\u2019m too selfish. I have no idea. I\u2019m all over the fuckin\u2019 map. Do you know what I want to do right now? I actually want to learn how to fly a helicopter, man. I do, that\u2019s my latest thing. You know why it is? It\u2019s \u2019cause I live in Los Angeles. Yeah, and it\u2019s an absolute clusterfuck. When you go into land in that city, just look out the window, and just look at the complete lack of planning. There\u2019s not even zoning laws. They\u2019ll build, like, a skyscraper next to a house, next to a gun range, and then there\u2019s, like, a fucking daycare center. Right? The city doesn\u2019t even work even when everything else works, so God forbid, the dollar collapses or some crazy shit happens, where you gonna go in a city like that? See, you guys are all right out here in Atlanta. You\u2019re all right. I don\u2019t know, maybe in Atlanta might be crazy. You\u2019re on the outskirts, you\u2019re fine. You\u2019re fine. You don\u2019t live in a desert. You slam your face in a birdbath, you\u2019re cool. Drink that water for a good 30 days. L.A., there\u2019s nowhere to go. That\u2019s why I love the helicopter. Dude, the helicopter is the ultimate \u201cfuck this, I\u2019m out\u201d vehicle. All you gotta do is assess the situation. Zombie coming up the street? \u201cFuck this! This looks safe.\u201d You just land it. You could sit there hovering. Just sit there in a hover watching everybody getting killed, sitting up there eating cheese and crackers with the red stick. Yeah, so I told my wife I want to fly a helicopter. She\u2019s just like, \u201cYeah, no.\u201d Which I know that came from a place of love, but it still kind of annoyed me. Just that she said that shit, then I was just gonna be like, \u201cOh, all right. Thought I was gonna get to do that, but you said no, so\u2026 there goes that. Hey, what other dreams aren\u2019t I gonna get to achieve? Like, do you already know or are you waiting for me to ask?\u201d Yeah, I\u2019m still gonna do it, I\u2019m just not gonna tell her. I\u2019m just gonna go out and do it, pass the goddamn class, and when I get my license, I\u2019m not going to tell her. I\u2019m just gonna go out and buy a white silk scarf, and hang it by a nail in the living room. She\u2019s just gonna be like, \u201cWhat is that? What is that for? What does that mean?\u201d \u201cYeah, someday you\u2019ll see, someday you\u2019ll see. When the shit hits the fan, and you\u2019re freaking the fuck out, and I\u2019m taking branches off some unforeseen helicopter.\u201d \u201cWhat is that?\u201d \u201cShut the fuck up and get in!\u201d Now you guys think I\u2019m bullshitting, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m serious. I\u2019m 100% in on this. And ever since I got into it, I\u2019m seeing helicopters everywhere. I never realized how many helicopters there were. Driving down the street like Henry Hill looking up at them\u2026 doing key bumps and shit. \u201cThey\u2019re after me! Swear to God!\u201d I\u2019m seeing stories about them! It\u2019s just like that old advertising anecdote. \u201cI never realized how many mattress commercials there were out there until I needed a mattress, and then all of a sudden, they\u2019re all over the place. And then I bought a mattress and then it all went away.\u201d It\u2019s the same shit. I saw this story down in Orange County. Right? Down in Orange County, California. This guy gave helicopter tours for 30 years\u2013 30 years without incident. Hands the business off to his son, the American dream. \u201cI built it up for 30 years. Here you go, son. Make the family and the family name proud.\u201d \u201cAll right, Dad, I love you.\u201d All right? This poor kid, five days in, he\u2019s supposed to give a tour to a couple, only the dude shows up. The kid thought it was weird, but he\u2019s like, \u201cI need the money. I gotta give him a tour.\u201d Right? So he takes this guy up. Ten minutes into the tour, the dude fucking jumped out. Yeah, five days in. Five days in from the balloons and the cake. \u201cWe love you, son. Keep the family tree going. The traditional line.\u201d Five fucking days later, this kid, he probably barely had the speech down. Just sitting there, flying the helicopter. \u201cAll right, if you look out the left side of the aircraft, that\u2019s Orange County. There\u2019s over 27 miles of beaches there. Put your seatbelt back on, 27 miles of beaches. Was established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\u2019t open the door. Sir, what are you doing? Sir, no, no. Don\u2019t, don\u2019t, stop, no, no! What the fuck? What the fuck? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the fuck, what the fuck?! Fuck!\u201d Air traffic control: \u201cI don\u2019t know who\u2019s on this frequency, but you really need\u2013\u201d \u201cSomebody just jumped out of the fucking helicopter!\u201d Five days in. So I read further into the story. Turns out the guy who jumped out, he was 61 years old, terminally ill, he was in pain every day. They couldn\u2019t figure out what was wrong with him, and he had had enough. At that point, that guy immediately became a hero in my world. Know what I love about him, not only did he make the decision, he didn\u2019t go out like some pussy, right? Handful of pills, watching a romantic comedy, wrapped in an afghan that Nana made. Fuck that. Guy went out like a man. \u201cTake me up in a chopper, I\u2019m looking at the land I love, and then I\u2019m jumping out like a superhero.\u201d I loved it. Yeah. [applause] This guy should have been wearing a fucking cape. I can\u2019t imagine how elated he must have been on that helicopter ride up after finally just taking back control of his life, like, \u201cFuck you, disease. I decide.\u201d Ripping tubes out, gets a burger, shotguns a beer. \u201cTake me up in the chopper.\u201d He probably had his fucking foot on the dashboard. He\u2019s not even listening to this guy giving the tour. Right? \u201cOver 27 miles of beaches, put your seatbelt back on. Established as a county in 1903. Sir, please don\u2019t try to open the door. No, no, don\u2019t, don\u2019t, don\u2019t!\u201d [screams] [imitates wind whipping] Incredible! But here\u2019s the thing. I left out one small thing. There is one small thing. The guy fucking lived. Yeah. Yeah, they were out over the ocean, 500 feet up. You\u2019d think that would be enough so, I\u2019m thinking he must have gone in like Greg Louganis, like, no splash, just\u2026 But witnesses said it looked like a dummy was falling out of the air. So that sounds like a hell of an impact. I think he accidentally did the most epic 500-foot belly flop in the history of jumping out of a helicopter. But that didn\u2019t change what he was trying to do. Where his heart was, I still love this guy. I just feel bad for him. On the way down, he\u2019s got to be thinking, \u201cThree more seconds of pain! Two more seconds!\u201d Wham! [agonized scream] \u201cOh, my God, this is worse! This is way worse!\u201d It has a happy ending, though. He later died at the hospital. That\u2019s right. So here\u2019s to him. God bless him. I hope I have the balls someday. So where do you go from there? Well, as I mentioned, last time I came through town, I wanted to get a gun. You know? I do. Yeah. But I\u2019ve finally given up on that. I gave up on that dream. My wife doesn\u2019t want me to get one, so. Yeah, she didn\u2019t want\u2013 Dude, you got to pick your fucking battles. I\u2019m gonna learn how to fly a helicopter on the sly, I can\u2019t fucking have some .357 hanging around. \u201cI\u2019ll do whatever I want. All right? What I say goes! Eat it!\u201d Can\u2019t be that person. Now it fucking bums me out, \u2019cause all I wanted to do was just get a .22, that\u2019s all I wanted. Perfect gun for home protection, .22 caliber. You\u2019re laughing at that, sir? That\u2019s not enough? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m down South. What do you think? That\u2019s not enough, right? You want\u2013 Shotgun, right? .44? You guys are out of your minds. You\u2019re out of your fucking minds. Let me ask all you gun guys, who are gonna make fun if I had a .22. \u201cWhat\u2019s with your .22? That little queer gun. Do you keep it between your buttocks? Is that the holster? Is that what you do with your gay little gun? You need a big gun.\u201d All you fucking guys. Let me ask you this, all you guys with your guns\u2026 have you ever shot the fucking thing without earplugs? Have you ever done that? Or you\u2019re like most people, you take it down to the gun range, you put your earplugs in, put your headset on, take it out of the briefcase. You got your little yellow tinted fucking glasses, right? You look at your spread or whatever, and then you put it back in there, right? You ever shot that thing without fucking earplugs? \u2018Cause that\u2019s what\u2019s gonna happen when that intruder comes in. You\u2019re not gonna have time to be, \u201cHang on a second, let me just\u2026\u201d Yeah, you\u2019re not gonna have time. Dude, I shot a five-shot .38 one time without earplugs. I was landscaping this guy\u2019s yard. He comes out at the end of the job. \u201cHey, I got this five-shot .38. You want to go down the street? There\u2019s a burned-out car. We can take a couple of shots.\u201d You know what\u2019s funny? Every other state is fuckin\u2019 dying laughing at this point in the joke because it\u2019s so goddamn ridiculous, until I get down to the South. And you guys just sit here staring at me like, \u201cAll right, so what happened? Pretty standard, I thought this was gonna be a comedy show. You\u2019re reading from your journal? I don\u2019t understand what the\u2013 It\u2019s not a real compelling story.\u201d I\u2019m mowing a fucking lawn, and a stranger comes out with a weapon and says, \u201cLet\u2019s shoot it at a burned-out car!\u201d Okay? Jesus Christ, can we agree on that? So I\u2019m like, all right, let\u2019s do it, fuck it. So I go down there. Never shot a gun before. I bring the gun up, point it at the car, I pull the trigger. I saw the muzzle flash, I felt a kick, I never heard the gun. I pulled the trigger, all I just heard was\u2026 [high-pitched tone] I shot the gun four more times. Never heard it. Didn\u2019t get louder, didn\u2019t get quieter. Just kept seeing flashes. [high-pitched tone] All right? So let\u2019s take one of your fucking guns. Let\u2019s just say, for the sake of argument. All right, you got that thing sitting on a nightstand, loaded. Right? For God\u2019s sakes, tell me you have it there. Don\u2019t be one of these people that has the gun here and the bullets there. You got the thing fucking loaded, ready to go. 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, this is when the psycho\u2019s coming in too, right? That\u2019s when they come in, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning. They don\u2019t come by at 6:30 at night, as you\u2019re cutting into a pork chop. \u201cI\u2019m out of my mind, I\u2019m coming back in 20 minutes, so stretch out your hammies \u2019cause it\u2019s gonna get crazy.\u201d That\u2019s not how it works. They wait till you\u2019re dead asleep, 3:00, 4:00 in the morning, right before REM sleep is kicking in. So let\u2019s just say for the sake of argument, all you gun guys, you got your thing loaded, right? Your piece, right? Right there, loaded for bear. You\u2019re lying there, same scenario, right? One leg under the covers, one without. Shirt. 4:00 in the morning, you\u2019re just\u2026 [snoring] Meanwhile, some psycho, sneaking in through the living room window, right? He brings in a fucking sickle. And he\u2019s just listening. Listens all the way down that hall and he just hears\u2026 [snoring] He\u2019s trying not to squeak on the floorboards. And you\u2019re just fucking lying there. [snoring] All of a sudden, that little dog on the floor is just like\u2026 [low growling] [growling and snoring continue] \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the matter? What\u2019s the matter, boy? You hear something? What\u2019s the matter? What are you barking for? You\u2019re shaking. What\u2019s the matter, huh? You hear something? What\u2019s\u2013? Come on, man, quit fucking around. I got to go to work tomorrow.\u201d [snoring] All of a sudden, boom! That door flies open. You just see this shadowy figure. You pick up that gun. Blam! [high-pitched tone] And you fucking miss! You miss! You can\u2019t see, now you can\u2019t hear. That\u2019s two out of five senses! What, are you gonna taste him as he comes around the bed? You\u2019re still gonna be shooting over here. Meanwhile, you see this strobe light psycho coming around the fucking bed. Takes off your head. If you had the .22, you could still hear. Your ears would be ringing, but you could hear that fucker coming across, and you could shoot at him, and he would leave. He would leave. You guys just won\u2019t get off the fact that it\u2019s a fuckin\u2019 .22. You\u2019re, like, psychotic with this shit. All right. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let me\u2013 I will extend an olive branch to you people, okay? I get it. I get it that a .22 is basically a \u2018roided-up BB gun. I got it, okay? I understand that if you actually want to kill somebody, you have to basically have the gun up to somebody\u2019s head and be throwing a jab as you pull the trigger. I understand that. Okay? But I maintain, I don\u2019t care who the fuck the toughest person is in this house. I could defend my house with a BB gun. I don\u2019t give a fuck how tough you are. I don\u2019t care. If I started shooting at you with a BB gun, at the very least, you have to go back outside and regroup. That\u2019s a fact. That is a fact. If I caught you in your elbow, that might be the end of your night. \u201cLook, I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m coming back!\u201d I\u2019ve been trying to get along with my wife better. I\u2019m trying to dial down the douchebaggery in my relationship. I\u2019m not turning out the pilot light, though. All right? I\u2019m keeping some fight in me. I\u2019m not gonna be that henpecked guy just standing there like, \u201cI guess we\u2019re making holiday cookies.\u201d That dude with the bowed shoulders. \u201cShe makes them and then I\u2019m supposed to sprinkle the sugar on them. I don\u2019t even think they taste that good, but just\u2013\u201d No, I stand my ground sometimes. Sometimes I let it go. You just got to figure it out. We had a fight the other night, she got so mad at me, she was like, \u201cYou can just sleep downstairs. You can just sleep downstairs.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s one of the most arrogant things I\u2019ve ever heard in my life. One adult telling another adult where they can sleep. \u201cYou can just sleep downstairs.\u201d Like I was just gonna sit up in bed, grab a blanket like Linus. \u201cAll right. Hey, where downstairs, by the way? Like, over here downstairs, or like more over here? Where should I sleep?\u201d It\u2019s like, are you out of your mind? I go, \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping downstairs.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWhere you gonna sleep, then?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhere I always sleep. I will fucking sleep on your side of the bed if I want to! What are you gonna do? I\u2019m bigger than you. I\u2019ll hang onto the covers, try to get me out. No tickling. Go ahead!\u201d Yeah, I was like, \u201cYou don\u2019t tell me where to sleep. I sleep where I want to sleep.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t tell me where to sleep.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not the one telling people where to sleep!\u201d It was one of those classic relationship fights. It\u2019s like 2:00 in the morning, you\u2019re both half naked. She\u2019s not wearing a bra, you got half a ball hanging out. \u201cAnd another thing! No, no, I need to say this! The other day, I felt slighted!\u201d It\u2019s fuckin\u2019 unreal, but what kills me is that there\u2019s actually guys out there that will actually listen to that shit. Yeah, you talk to them, they\u2019ll be, \u201cHey, how\u2019s it been going?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been rough last of couple nights downstairs on the couch. You know how that is, right?\u201d No, I don\u2019t. I don\u2019t understand. How did you get yourself into that situation? Like, what are you afraid of? What is she gonna do if you say no? What, is she gonna fucking chokeslam you onto the kitchen table? I understand if you\u2019re dating some woman and she does that UFC MMA shit, then you got to sleep where she says to sleep, you got to. She\u2019s gonna come at you. \u201cWell, let\u2019s get you in an arm bar.\u201d \u201cAll right, all right, all right!\u201d Tapping out. Or even worse, she chokes you out. You wake up on the couch, like, 11 minutes later. Just grab your jacket off the back of the couch. \u201cI fucking hate when she does this. It\u2019s like, it\u2019s not even fair. Have a debate like a normal person.\u201d All right? I\u2019m gonna talk somebody down from a ledge here, someone who\u2019s actually been sleeping on the couch, okay? So there\u2019s the first fear, out the window. Okay, she can\u2019t physically dominate you, so that\u2019s gone. What\u2019s the next fear? She\u2019s gonna cut off the sex. Yeah, rub one out. Neutralized. It\u2019s the most empty threat there is. Do it right in front of her. \u201cJoin me!\u201d Yeah. I\u2019ve never understood that threat. That\u2019s like somebody putting a chain around your refrigerator, but you got a sandwich in your pocket, a never-ending sandwich, like some biblical shit, like Jesus with the fucking bread or whatever. So now what\u2019s the last thing she can do? What can she do now? Be moody? You can\u2019t handle that? Walk by your TV without looking at you. Only make herself something yummy out in the kitchen. Who gives a fuck? My wife does that, I just sit there, I just start commentating. \u201cHere she comes again, walking by the TV. She really must be mad.\u201d She\u2019s never body-slammed me once, ever. I\u2019m not saying to be a dick. All right? I\u2019m just saying, you got to keep them honest. Every once in a while, you got to have a little pushback. \u201cHey, hey, hey, hey, hey.\u201d Rest of the shit\u2013 I\u2019m learning that about women. You just want to keep them calm. Just keep them calm, like a rescue dog, right? Just everything\u2019s cool, everything\u2019s cool, just, \u201cYeah, yeah, yeah, this is great, this is great, I\u2019m having a great time. No, your friends are awesome, your friends are awesome, very interesting party. I am talking to people, I\u2019m talking to people, I am having a good time here.\u201d That\u2019s what you do. You just do that enough, then when you bark back, you got a little something. Here\u2019s an olive branch I\u2019ve extended to her. It\u2019s basically\u2026 We fight a lot over television. I\u2019ve kind of come her way, she\u2019s come my way. She watches a little bit of sports, I occasionally will watch a romantic comedy. Which, I don\u2019t care, the nerd\u2019s gonna fuck the cheerleader. I\u2019ll watch it, right? I don\u2019t mind them, it\u2019s an uplifting story. I just don\u2019t like the love scenes in romantic comedies. They creep me out. They\u2019re just so fucking nice. It\u2019s, like, missionary-style. There\u2019s candles. That stupid saxophone music. [imitates saxophone] It always goes down. Like the saxophone implies the penetration, right? \u2018Cause they can\u2019t show it. They got to make her this one-dimensional, this little angel. They ignore the other 90% of her sexuality. No hair-pulling, no ass-slapping, none of that shit. None of that taboo stuff of a woman\u2019s sexuality. That\u2019s never brought up. That whole \u201cHold me down but let me up, but hold me down. Choke me, but let me breathe, but kind of scare the shit out of me a little bit. I want to feel your power but I want to be safe, but let me know if you really wanted to.\u201d That whole Fifty Shades of Rape, whatever the hell that is. Yeah. I don\u2019t even pretend to understand it. I remember the first time a woman wanted to get me to choke her a little bit. I didn\u2019t even know what she was doing. I was just so psyched to be getting laid, I was like\u2026 And she just kept taking my hand, and she kept putting it right here. I didn\u2019t know what she was doing. I thought she was testing my core strength or some shit. And finally, I was just like, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d She says, like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just kinda like, ya know. It\u2019s like squeeze a little bit and kind of like squeeze it. Why don\u2019t you want to do it? It\u2019ll be fun.\u201d Why don\u2019t I want to do it? I don\u2019t think I want a passed-out naked woman with my fingerprints all around her neck. Having the cops show up. \u201cYeah, she\u2019s in here, Officer. Damndest thing, it was her idea. I swear to God, it was her idea!\u201d Yeah, they always make it nice in those movies. The raciest thing they\u2019ll do is every once in a while, they\u2019ll kiss up against a wall. I guess women like walls. I didn\u2019t know that. A lot of up-against-the-wall kissing. \u201cOh, my God, it\u2019s the wall. Oh, my God! It\u2019s supporting me, maybe he\u2019ll support me, it\u2019s a metaphor, I love it.\u201d Yeah, I saw one the other night, they were doing that, and then out of nowhere, they started having sex up against the wall. I\u2019m like, finally, something a little bit more interesting, right? But they were doing it standing up facing each other, missionary-style. Arguably one of the most difficult positions there is, and they were doing it with little to no difficulty. All she did was lift her leg up like that, and that was it. He was off to the races. I ruined the movie for my wife. I\u2019m like, \u201cThat is fucking bullshit! Bullshit.\u201d What does the guy have, like, a U-shaped dick? How is he doing anything? Is he sticking it in her navel? Did he grease up her thighs, to hell with her needs? Like, if all she\u2019s gonna do is this, she\u2019s got to bring it up like an offsides call, if that\u2019s what she\u2019s doing. All right? If not, you got to make some adjustments. You just got to grab the other leg, you got to try to pick her up there, use these muscles. [screaming] Maybe you could grab a doorjamb, drop down, try to come in, try to do that. Dude, nobody can do that other than a porn star for longer than 18 seconds before they\u2019re like, \u201cAll right, this is ridiculous, okay? My calves are burning, I can\u2019t get nearly enough momentum to do any sort of damage. I can literally feel you getting on with your day with every pathetic attempt to try and rock your world.\u201d These guys in the movie, they have no problem banging away, then they pick them up like they\u2019re not heavy. They start walking down, they see the bed, they just lay her down on the bed. Dude, I\u2019m not trying to be a dick, but every woman in here is heavy. Yeah, you\u2019re heavy. You\u2019re an adult female! Jesus Christ, when do you stop picking up your kids? When they\u2019re, like, five or six? \u201cGet off of me! Jesus Christ. You\u2019re gonna throw out my back. Go jump on your brother.\u201d An adult woman weighs 115 pounds, 120, all the way up to God knows what. And it\u2019s not balanced weight. Most of it\u2019s in your thighs and in your ass. Your head\u2019s hanging off trying to counterbalance. Dude, when guys go to the gym, we don\u2019t put 30 pounds on one side and a buck-80 over here. \u201cFuckin\u2019 yeah!\u201d Yeah, it\u2019s ridiculous. Trying to carry a naked woman, it\u2019s like trying to carry a half-filled waterbed mattress. You\u2019re, like, bumping into shit. When you see the bed, you don\u2019t walk to it, you slowly start picking up momentum. Then she bounces off this mattress, hits the wall, slides down, the whole sex vibe\u2019s ruined, and you\u2019re back to your sandwich in your pocket. All right, I\u2019m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. I had a great time. I\u2019ll see you next time. Thank you. [cheers and applause]","bo":"Bo What? Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O And on that farm he had a pig E I E I O Here a snort There a Old MacDonald had a farm E I E I O [Applause] This is Bo Burnham. He\u2019s 22 years old. He\u2019s a male. And he looks like the genetic product of a giraffe having sex with Ellen Degeneres. He has a gigantic head and tiny nipples. He\u2019s isolated himself over the last 5 years in pursuit of comedy. And, in doing so, has lost touch with reality. You\u2019re an asshole, Bo. You hear me? You think you know better than me. You think you know better than everybody. You will die alone. And you will deserve it. But in the meantime, you might as well tell those silly jokes of yours. See if that helps. [Up beat music starts] You used to do comedy when you felt like being funny. But now you\u2019re contractially obligated so dance you fucking monkey. DANCE, MONKEY, DANCE! Welcome to the show this is Bo, this is his show. And Bo likes to dance like this. Welcome to the show, this is Bo this is his show. And Bo takes off his pants like this. Play an invisible drum. [Invisible drum sounds] Play an invisible trumpet. Trumpet sound! Drink some invisible water, OH SHIT! That water is real! Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. Random voice Bo wants to make you feel comfortable. So sit back, relax, and enjoy a healthy dose of prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. prolonged eye contact. Lick your lips to make it more comforting. Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Yeah! Do you wanna see a magic trick? Then pick a card any card. SIKE! Magic isn\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\u2019t real, you idiot. Read a book. Magic isn\u2019t real. Or is it? And at that moment, Bo\u2019s 20-year-old cynicism melted into childlike wonder. He never knew there could be so much magic in the world. It\u2019s a world of possibilities, Bo. What do you wanna do first? Run? Yeah, sure you can run. Fly? Well yeah, you can fly. What? What are you\u2026 What the fuck you\u2026 What the fuck are you doing? Stop- St- Stop it! What the f- You fucking idiot, stop. Stop. Stop. Anyways. In the distance, Bo saw a beautiful fairy. A fairy so beautiful that he felt proud about being called one in high school. He then came across an old bridge with a troll standing guard. Bo knew that he\u2019d have to answer a riddle to get by. The troll spoke thus: \u201cAll right, for the last time man, I\u2019m not a troll.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m homeless.\u201d \u201cOkay? Do you have any spare change?\u201d \u201cOkay, that\u2019s a used napkin.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t want that.\u201d \u201cNo. No, stop. Just-\u201d \u201cYou know, leave. Just leave. Please leave.\u201d And then, as Bo arrived on the other side of the stage, he saw a unicorn with 5 horns right in front of him. And the pentacorn spoke thus: \u201cHello, Bo!\u201d \u2018I\u2019ve been looking for you for quite a long time no-\u201d [Gunshots] [Reloading] [Gunshots] He was safe. For now\u2026 But the dark thoughts would soon return. IT\u2019S GODZILLA! AAAAHHHHH!!! AAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! [Screeching] OH MY GOD AHHHHH!!!! [Screeching] GODZILLA!! AAAAAUUUGGHHHHHH!!! [Screeching] It\u2019s so hard to be a lizard. It\u2019s hard to be a lizard. Tiny arms, itchy gizzard. It\u2019s hard to be a lizard. But it\u2019s harder to segue. Is he skiing? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? What? Or is he in a gay porn? Is he skiing? Huh! Or is he in a gay porn? Here\u2019s a hint. He\u2019s in a gay porn. Okay Bo, this miming shit is getting pretty annoying. So give \u2019em the real thing! [Autotuned] My voice is so fucking natural. [Autotuned] It\u2019s naturally good. [Out of tune] Naturally good! Na-a-a-aturally good. This is the end of the song and the beginning of the show. Welcome to the show! [Applause] That lizard part was pretty fucking stupid. Anyway, San Francisco! Yeah! We are a place. We are a place. In California- Um, I\u2019d like to, uh, I\u2019d like to start with a joke for my male audience. Uh, this is a joke for the fellas. Where are my fellas at? FELLAS?! [Fellas respond] Yo, fellas don\u2019t you hate it when you\u2019re blowing a guy and he ends up being a faggot? AM I RIGHT?! I\u2019ve been blowing a faggot this whole time? Third time this week. Thank you so much. We\u2019re having fun\u2026 This, um- This show is called \u201cwhat\u201d. And I hope there are some surprises for you, or someth- Jesus, sorry. It\u2019s a good start. Uh, hope there\u2019s- He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Art is a lie. Nothing is real! So, um, we uh- Grow up! Grow up with your applause. Stick it\u2026 He meant to knock the water over. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you all thought it was an acc\u2013 Just, don\u2019t, if it\u2019s on repeat it will repeat. Just\u2026 we can cut all this, so\u2026 We meant to play the track again. Yeah, yeah, yeah! But you all thought it was an accident. But, he meant to play the water track a-ga-ga-gain! Art\u2019s still a lie. Nothing\u2019s still real! Food jokes. Let\u2019s do some food jokes. Segues are weird. Um\u2026 [Laughs] I had a hot dog for breakfast today, and afterwards I felt like this. Cos I couldn\u2019t control my stools. Alright, Jesus\u2026 I\u2019m glad you like poop based puns They will be a majority of the show. Never waste a moment, every moment can become a comedic moment. See. So\u2026 Just a little lesson for comedians. This first song, is called: \u201cA world on fire\u201d [Screaming] This next song, it\u2019s a little bit\u2026 it\u2019s a little bit longer then that one. And\u2026 Thank you. It\u2019s about how sad I am, and I\u2019m really sad, it\u2019s called \u201cSad\u201d [Piano music] It\u2019s about all the sad stuff Just picture a depressed onion cutting it self. [Gasps] I met a homeless man named Rich. Isn\u2019t that terrible? I saw a flyer for a lost dog, and the dog did not have any legs. I saw a diabetic kid, trick-or-treating. I saw a giraffe who had a short neck. That was sad, or a dear? I saw an old man get hit by a train. He didn\u2019t see it in the pouring rain. He didn\u2019t hear me shout: \u201clook out for the train!\u201d Cos I didn\u2019t say anything. I just thought to my self: \u201cOoh, this is going to be sad.\u201d And it was. I\u2019m a genius. [gasps] I saw a man with only one eye, in a 3D movie. I saw a little boy drop his ice cream cone directly on his mothers corpse! I saw a kitten stuck in a tree. Then the kitten jumped off and it hung it self I saw a boy who had red hair. I went to a store looking for something to buy. But they only sold paintings of the same sad guy. No wait! This store sells mirrors, see what I did there? LETS ROCK! No. The worlds is so sad bros. Pain. Genocide, war. Sexism, Racism. But I gotta remember there\u2019s good things about it too. Like the fact that none of that is happening to me. Score! Still though it\u2019s hard not to be sad about it. [to audience] How do you all do it? I\u2019ve been telling you guys terribly sad things this whole song you haven\u2019t been sad at all, you\u2019ve been\u2026 You\u2019ve been happy. No\u2026 You\u2019ve been laughing. That\u2019s it, laughter. That\u2019s the key to everything. It\u2019s the way to solve all the sadness in the world. I mean not for the people that are actually sad, but for people like us, that gotta fucking deal with them all the time. Being a comedian isn\u2019t being an insensitive prick, capitalizing on the most animalistic impulses of the public. It\u2019s being a hero. The world isn\u2019t sad, the world is funny. I\u2019m a sociopath! I saw an old man slip and fall. Hey, what a fucking idiot. I saw a woman at her daughters funeral. Ha-ha-ha. Classic comedy. Everything that once was sad is somehow funny now. The holocaust and 9\/11, that shit\u2019s funny 24\/7. Cos tragedy will be exclusively joked about. Because my empathy is bumming me out. God-bye sadness! Hello jokes. Thank you. [applause] I\u2019ve got a really good joke about video editors. Video editors are so fucking\u2026 I think we should do a poem right now, if that\u2019s OK? This poem is a little bit sappy, a little bit romantic, so we\u2019ll get it out of the way now, and we\u2019ll go back to the\u2026 Oops\u2026 the dirty stuff, you know. Everyone loves at a late show or whatever. OK It\u2019s called: \u201cI fuck sluts\u201d [audience member yells] It\u2019s not a roll call but thank you. Sluts! Sluts! [laughs] Sluts! Sluts! I fuck sluts. Sluts get fucked when I fuck sluts. No ifs ands or buts. I fuck sluts! I fuck sluts! Nice girls are nice. But no good for nut sucking. They\u2019ll need a serene night to green-light a buttfucking. But that\u2019ll be easy with sleazy old slut fucking. Boo to the nice girls, praise be to slut fucking. I have a list. A list? Yes, a list of all the sluts I\u2019ve missed. I\u2019ve never fucked or sucked these sluts. And thus my nuts are fucking pissed. So when I fuck the lucky slut my nut removes her from the list. Another dumb cum-bucket struck from my nut sucking, suck it slut, slut fucking, bucket list. [applause] Yes, you hear the influences: Chaucer, Keats. Um\u2026 The pages are blank, I know it. Why am I lying to you? Sluts can be white, black, brown, pink, or almond. They can be skinny with big tits, or be skinny with small ones. Sluts can be perky, prepy or posh, with their brains and their clothes all shrunk from the wash. Excuse me. But other sluts are pretty and funny and smart. These sluts can lift all your thoughts from your dick to your heart. They can talk about science music or art. They can put you together, or they can pull you apart. But don\u2019t trust there sluts, Don\u2019t, don\u2019t you dare. They\u2019ll force you to trust them and love them and care And then they\u2019ll be gone and you\u2019ll be aware of the hole in your heart that that dumb slut left there. Thank you very much. [applause] So, he was lashing out with sexist language cos he had his heart broken. We all learn something. Thank you all for coming. I know some of my bits are a little bit fast and dense, a little bit hard to follow, particularly that one. So I want to do something a little bit slower, for the people, maybe the older people in the crowd, or something, so umm\u2026 [laughter] This\u2019s for you: Here\u2019s a slow joke. [slowdown sound] [talking in slo-mo] What did the ear of corn say [talking in slo-mo] when all of it\u2019s clothes fell off? [talking in slo-mo] Aww, shucks! [talking in slo-mo] Get it? [talking in slo-mo] Like \u201cshucks\u201d as in shucking corn [talking in slo-mo] and also \u201cshucks\u201d the exclamation. [talking in slo-mo] Am I right? [laughter] [speedup sound] Good. We\u2019re having fun. Umm\u2026 My father recently told me that I act too flamboyant on stage. And I said: \u201creally dad?\u201d \u201cProve it!\u201d [laughter] He sad: \u201cWell what about that joke\u201d \u201cwhere you throw confetti at the end of it?\u201d I said: \u201cwell I haven\u2019t written that joke yet,\u201d \u201ccos it\u2019s based of this conversation!\u201d \u201cGotcha!\u201d Keep it, keep the struggle. We are having a lot of fun guys. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to fill the silences with laughter or applause. I don\u2019t want you leaving this show thinking: \u201cMy hands hurt from clapping.\u201d \u201cMy stomach hurts from laughing.\u201d I just want you leaving the show, thinking: \u201cMeh\u2026 alright\u2026\u201d And we are on our way. I moved to, um\u2026 Hollywood recently from Boston, where I grew up and\u2026 [audience member yells] Places! And I\u2026 [laughs] I heard about these sort of wild Hollywood party nights that people would have and I did not think they were true. Until I moved to Hollywood and I started having them. Anyway, this is a song about a crazy night that happened a couple of weeks ago. It\u2019s called: \u201cWhat did I do last night?\u201d [Electronic music starts] Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! What did I do last night? I cried my self to sleep! [Music stops] [Laughter] [applause] It was a good one. When did my mother first describe gay sex to me? Good question, I was 8 years old\u2026 I was 8 years old, she brought me into the dining room, she sat right across the table from me. She said: \u201cDo you know how your father and I love each other\u201d I said: \u201cOf course.\u201d \u201cYou and dad love each other\u201d \u201cmore then two people could possible love each other.\u201d She said: \u201cWell two men can love each other in the exact same way\u201d \u201cthat your father and I love each other.\u201d She said: \u201cwhat happens when two men love each other like that.\u201d \u201cWhat they do is, they take off all their clothes\u201d \u201cUmm.. they get into bed\u201d \u201cAnd they SHIT ON THE BIBLE!\u201d [laughter] So I don\u2019t talk to her anymore. OK [80\u2019s sf sounds] [Robotic voice] Hello patient #24602 Hi. I\u2019m sorry. [Robotic voice] How are you feeling? Not great. [Robotic voice] Has the treatment been working?

I have trouble articulati\u2026 Like, other people, and relating to them\u2026 [Robotic voice] So basically you\u2019re still a little bitch? Real mature of you, disembodied voice.

That\u2019s your opinion\u2026 So just\u2026 Be careful with opinions\u2026 Yooo! [Robotic voice] Play nice. I am the left brain. I am the left brain. I work really hard to my inevitable death brain. You\u2019ve got a job to do, you better do it right. And the right way is with the left brains might. I like Oreos and pussy! Yeah! ok! And I cried for at least an hour after watching Toy Story 3. I am the right brain. I have feelings. I\u2019m a little all over the place, but I\u2019m lustful, trustful, and I\u2019m looking for somebody to love. And put my penis in! Here comes a female, here comes a female. Puff your chest out take your phone and check your e-mail Our evolutionary purpose is repopulate, so gather data now and see if she\u2019s a possible mate. Holy fuck! I think she might be the one! There\u2019s something about her, I just can\u2019t describe it. Tits. I am the earth she is the glorious sun. I want her to trust me, and I just want her to sit on my face. Sit\u2026 sit\u2026 Alright new right brain, you\u2019re being insane. No left brain! I\u2019m just being alive! You should try it. You might like it. I worked hard to give him everything he cared about. You were worried about the things he was scared about. I\u2019m calm and collected when you act wild. I am the adult, you are the child. You think you are the right one every time. You think you know everything. You don\u2019t know anything at all. Half of his problems were supposed to be mine. But you wanted everything. I hope that you\u2019re happy. Cos he\u2019s sure not. Well according to my calculations, you are a pussy! Name calling? Really? We\u2019re going to do name calling? We are not calling names. We are just stating facts. And the fact is: You\u2019re a quivering pussy. I\u2019m the pussy? Well at least I don\u2019t play with toys still. OK, Rubik\u2019s cubes are not toys. They keep my spacial reasoning skills sharp. Left brain plays with toys. Look at you, Johnny fucking\u2026 toy player! Well at least I did my fucking job. I kept him working, I kept him productive. You were supposed to look after him. You were supposed to keep him emotionally stable through all this, now you are trying to blame me for how he\u2019s feeling. How he\u2019s feeling? If he\u2019s feeling unhappy, it\u2019s because you failed him. You did this to him, he hates you I know he does. He fucking hates you! [crying] Right brain, look, I\u2019m sorry. No you\u2019re not\u2026 Look, maybe there\u2019s something that we could do together. Together? Take the best parts of both of us. And put them together. I\u2019m listening\u2026 It would let you let your feelings out, it would let me analyse. So you could man the themes, I\u2019ll man the form. It\u2019s something that George Carlin did, It\u2019s something that Steve Martin did, It\u2019s something special that we could both perform. Do you know what it is? Juggling? We could juggle, and juggle our cares away! It was comedy. We could do comedy together. [Robotic voice] Initiate reassembly. Alright, right brain, we are going to do comedy together. Altight left brain, I\u2019ll do comedy with you. Look, we can fix him like this. Make him happy again. I promise. Left brain\u2026 Left brain I love you! I know. [Robotic voice] Experimentation complete. Thank you very much. [applause] At this part of the show I\u2019d like to talk about how deep I am. [laughter] [piano music] I\u2019m pretty fucking deep\u2026 deep\u2026 deep\u2026 So deep\u2026 That I called this song\u2026 Hash-tag deep. Have you ever stopped to watch a bluebird drop from a tree and take to the air? Me neither. Have you ever took time out to finish a rhyme but the right words just weren\u2019t there? Meat cleaver. The people in my life, are like grains of sand. Cos they stick together. Often near my butthole. If life is an ocean, I am a deep and handsome fish. A fish that\u2019s drowning. If the artistic process is a birth canal then I am a freshly jellied kid, come witness my crowning. These thoughts of mine, must be a sign that I\u2019m, hash-tag deep. If Jesus can walk on water, can he swim on land? Have you ever accidentally peed on the toilet seat instead of on your girlfriends face. Me neither. Me neither! Have you ever wrote a song note for note, and not a single note was out of place. [out of tune playing] The people in my life, are like blades of grass. How? Cos they\u2019re all so grounded, But at least grass stays away from my BUTTHOLE! Art is a harlot, and I am her sassy urban friend. Oooh\u2026 That\u2019s why you\u2019re being so selfish. If mamma is right, and the world is my oyster, then I must have an allergy to shell\u2026 You don\u2019t know, how could you know? If life makes you wish you were dead. Just put on a good movie then promptly put a bullet in your head. Spend forever asleep. Cos life pales in comparison to living the dream. Hash-tag deep. [music ends] Thank you. [applause] [happy music starts playing] [music stops] [sad music] Don\u2019t you hate it when that happens? Yeah. Thank you, That\u2019s called: \u201cBeating off in A minor\u201d. Yes\u2026 Yes\u2026 \u201cA-minor\u201d, the key, not the felony. So\u2026 I believe\u2026 [laughs] I believe there\u2019s nothing more manly one can do then take a shower with 5 other guys. It\u2019s true. It\u2019s early caveman, Cro-Magnon, wandering though the fog. You know scrubbing 5 other sapiens, no homo. [laughter] I\u2019d like to do\u2026 erm\u2026 do some poems right now. Erm\u2026 if that\u2019s OK? We\u2019re at this point at the show. These poems are actually\u2026 I\u2019m releasing this special for free so I\u2019m going to plug my poetry book. These are my new poems from my poetry book called \u201cEgghead\u201d. That will be out by the time this is airing. But not by the time you guys are seated here right now. They are pretty serious, and it\u2019s all just sort of\u2026 This is usually the lull of the show. Usually. So i like at this point to sort of take the pressure of the audience. And just read some poems, and then we\u2019ll go back to the giggles. So\u2026 This is a poem by a dog: \u201cRoses are gray. Violets are a different shade of gray.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s go chase cars.\u201d [Applause] + [Chimes] \u201cMe. With my strange choice of adjectives.\u201d \u201cYou with your muscular teeth and your clockwise vagina.\u201d [Chimes] \u201cI put a chameleon on a red dildo.\u201d Well\u2026 \u201cHe blushed!\u201d There we go. [Chimes] This is a poem about beauty, about self image, and about the ability to transform. \u201cMartha was ugly, like a shaven baboon.\u201d \u201cSo she wrapped her self up\u201d \u201cin a curtain cocoon.\u201d \u201cAnd after a week she finally emerged.\u201d \u201cShe smelled like shit! What a psycho.\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] \u201cYou\u2019re incomparable.\u201d \u201cLike a \u2026 \u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \u201cI want to beat you to death with a blunt object!\u201d \u201cI want to grab one of those\u201d \u201chigh end fashion manikins by the ankles\u201d \u201cand bash your rib cage in!\u201d \u201cI want to sharpen 15 pencils\u201d \u201cbind them with a rubber band\u201d \u201cstick the lead in your mouth\u201d \u201cand punch the erasers!\u201d \u201cI want to strap you to a bed of nails\u201d \u201cthen strap that bed of nails to the hood of my car\u201d \u201cso I can watch you suffer as we drive over speed bumps\u201d \u201cin a mall parking lot during an earthquake!\u201d \u201cI want you to somehow survive\u201d \u201ca terrible car crash and then somehow\u201d \u201cnot survive a small fender bender\u201d \u201con the way back from a hospital.\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] Thank you that\u2019s called \u201cDad\u201d. [Laughter] + [Applause] This is a poem\u2026 It\u2019s really a story that\u2019s meant primarily for children. But I think it\u2019s got a lesson we could all learn. \u201cThe squares lived happily.\u201d \u201cIn their square houses.\u201d \u201cIn their square yard.\u201d \u201cIn their square town.\u201d \u201cBut then one day,\u201d \u201ca family of circles moved in from the west\u201d \u201cGet out of here roundies!\u201d \u201cShouted one of the squares.\u201d \u201cWhy? Said one of the circles\u201d \u201cCos this is a metaphor for racism\u201d [Chimes] + [Laughter] + [Applause] \u201cWhen I walk into a party\u201d \u201cyou\u2019d think I was one of those long straight Tetris pieces\u201d \u201ccos everyone\u2019s just like: Oh yeah. This guy\u2019s here\u201d \u201cFinally we\u2019ve been waiting for him to show up\u201d Like you wait\u2026 in the game\u2026 Forget it. [Laughter] No. You had your chance. \u201cIf I had a million dollars\u201d \u201cI\u2019d pay your mother to have sex with me\u201d \u201cafterwards I\u2019d probably invest the remaining $999.990\u201d Ten dollars for sex with your mother. Comedy! I smell comedy. Well, it was comedy giving off that scent. And finally: \u201cMid October,\u201d \u201cwith leaves spilled like colored pencil shavings.\u201d \u201cThe streets dicing our town into neat, unfair portions.\u201d \u201cAnd me.\u201d \u201cEating that pussy baby!\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Thank you so much. Um\u2026 There\u2019s things that I don\u2019t want to come across In my show, that I worry often come across, about me, cos people don\u2019t realize it\u2019s an act up here. I don\u2019t want you to ever think that I think that I\u2019m better then people. or that i think I know better then people. Um\u2026 anyway, sorry. OK. This is a song from the perspective of God. [Laughter] + [Applause] + [Piano music] Books you think I wrote are way to thick. Who needs a thousand metaphos to figure out you shouldn\u2019t be a dick. And I don\u2019t watch you when you sleep Surprisingly I don\u2019t use my omnipotence to be a fucking creep. You\u2019re not going to heaven. Why the fuck would you think I\u2019d ever kick it with you? None of you are going to heaven. There\u2019s a trillion aliens cooler then you. You shouldn\u2019t abstain from rape just cos you think that I want you to. You shouldn\u2019t rape cos rape is a fucked up thing to do. Pretty obvious, just don\u2019t fucking rape people. Didn\u2019t think I needed to write that one down for you. I don\u2019t think masturbation is obscene. It\u2019s absolutely natural and the weirdest fucking thing I\u2019ve ever seen. You make my job a living hell. I send gays to fix overpopulation. Boy did that go well. You\u2019re not going to heaven. Eat a thousand crackers, sing a million hymns. None of you are going to heaven. You\u2019re not my children, you are a bad game of sim. You shouldn\u2019t abstain from pork just cos you think that I want you to. You can eat pork cos why the fuck would I give a shit? I created the universe, you think I\u2019m drawing the line at the fucking deli isle? [Laughter] + [applause] You argue and you bicker and you fight. Atheists and Catholics, Jews and Hindus argue day and night. Over what they think is true. But no one entertains the thought, that maybe God does not Believe in you. You pray so badly for heaven. Knowing any day might be the day that you die. But maybe life on earth could be heaven? Doesn\u2019t just the thought of it make it worth a try? My love\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\u2019t need it. My love\u2019s the type of thing that you have to earn. And when you earn it you won\u2019t need it. I\u2019m not gonna give you love just cos I know that you want me to. If you want love then the love has gotta come from you. [Music ends] + [Applause] [Rock music] \u201cWalking between the micorphones\u201d \u201cis really awkward.\u201d Tell me about it. Um\u2026 Women are stupid! Yeah I fucking said it. They are the weaker, dumber sex. I can prove it to you. I like to practice safe sex. Why? Cos I\u2019m a guy. And I\u2019m smarter. What do women say, every time? Every time i put on a condom, what do they say? \u201cWhy are you wearing a condom?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m fucking you with a strap-on.\u201d To be safe bitch! Women right, they\u2019re the dumb ones. It\u2019s time for a story. Let\u2019s do a story. [Happy music] \u201cIt\u2019s time for a story.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for a story.\u201d \u201cA very special story\u201d \u201cEspecially for you.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for a story.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time for a story!\u201d \u201cSit down and listen now.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t be a Jew.\u201d This story is called\u2026 It\u2019s a glitch! You can be Jewish. This story\u2026 This story is called: \u201cAndy the frog\u201d. Featuring long and convoluted similes. And I\u2019ll warn you when one of those long and convoluted similes rears it\u2019s old, head. So here we go: \u201cOnce upon a time, there was a frog name Andy.\u201d [Frog noise] \u201cAndy lived at the patent park pond.\u201d \u201cAnd he never hopped anywhere else\u201d \u201cin his entire frog life.\u201d \u201cHe had three best friends:\u201d \u201cMilly, who never left her lily pad.\u201d [Laughs] \u201cBilly, who was always hopping mad.\u201d \u201cAnd Roger, who was arrested for possession of tadpole porn.\u201d [Laughter] \u201cSo one day\u2026\u201d \u201cOne day\u2026\u201d \u201cAndy saw something hop across the grass\u201d \u201con the other side of the pond.\u201d \u201cMilly, Billy, Roger, look! -Said Andy.\u201d \u201cAcross the pond stood\u201d \u201cThe most beautiful frog Andy had ever seen.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s gorgeous! -Said Milly.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful! -Said Billy.\u201d \u201cA bit old for my taste! -Said Roger.\u201d \u201cClassic Roger!\u201d \u201cAnd then she was gone.\u201d \u201cI need to go find her! -Said Andy.\u201d \u201cI need to follow my little frog heart.\u201d \u201cSo Andy followed the beautiful frogs footsteps into the forest.\u201d \u201cHe then came across a turtle.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t pass! -Said the turtle.\u201d \u201cPlease? -Said Andy.\u201d \u201cNo! -Said the turtle.\u201d And this is the first long convoluted simile: \u201cThen there was a rustling in the bushes.\u201d \u201cAnd, like a man who had been shot in the chest with a rifle,\u201d \u201cthe turtle was shot in the chest with a rifle.\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] \u201cAndy kept moving, but at this point,\u201d \u201clike the doctor of the Kenyan track team\u201d \u201chis patience ran thin.\u201d \u201cAndy kept moving.\u201d [Laughter] \u201cHe then came across a giant crocodile.\u201d \u201cAnd the crocodile began to chant:\u201d \u201cI woke up this morning,\u201d \u201cAnd I sat on a log.\u201d \u201cI opened up the menu,\u201d \u201cthe menu said FROG!\u201d [Laughs] \u201cAndy said: No! No! Please let go of me!\u201d \u201cI can feel my self dying!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re ripping out my insides!\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never going to find her, am i?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no God, Is there?\u201d \u201cFuck!\u201d \u201cFUCK!!!!\u201d The end. The end! So, that\u2019s the end of that story. [Applause] + [Laughter] If you are curious, the moral of that story is irrelevant, cos we are humans. Why would it apply to us? Um\u2026 You know my father is so hard to get along with. Cos he\u2019s such a man\u2019s man. You know? He believes, like, for example: You should always fight fire with fire. Which is a horrible way to live your life. Especially for him, because he\u2019s a firefighter so\u2026 He was fired\u2026 That was as stupid as we get. But let\u2019s get a little stupider, ha? \u201cThere\u2019s a creepy old man\u201d \u201cfishing in a park.\u201d \u201cand the only problem is\u201d \u201che tied a candy bar\u201d \u201cto the end of his line.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s trying to catch a kid.\u201d You know that stuff\u2026 Trying to get a little more mainstream. [Laughs] Um\u2026 People complain about the way I act on stage very often, you know. They say, like, I repeat jokes. Or they also say that They say\u2026 They don\u2019t get again, that this is an act, on stage. They think on stage I act too arrogant, too self-obsessed, solipsistic, self-contained, synonyms. And they want me to be\u2026 They want me to be a comic of the people. You know. Relate to the people with the overarching glue of comedy. So I want to do a little bit of relatable comedy for you guys. I\u2019m like you guys, you know. Once a week I like to slip into a deep existential depression where I loose all my sense of oneness and self worth. Ha-ha! And what I like to do in order to assure my self that I am unique, and not just one of many small white indistinguishable perfectly cylindric checker pieces in Jesus and Satan\u2019s backgammon game. Is, I will\u2026 I\u2019ll say a group a words that I think no one has ever said. in that order. So that\u2026 when I say it, I feel like: \u201clook at me!\u201d Participating in this new moment that no one\u2019s ever been a part of. So I\u2019ll say something random like like: \u201cPeanut-butter tribadism.\u201d Or: \u201cI\u2019m your father and I loved your comedy show.\u201d Or: \u201cAt first I wasn\u2019t comfortable leaving him alone with my children\u201d \u201cbut then I saw his mustache. Phew\u2026\u201d Or um\u2026 Or: \u201cYo! Check out this Amish website!\u201d Or um\u2026 Or: \u201cI work at a toll booth and I don\u2019t want to kill my self.\u201d Or\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026 too\u2026 Too real. Or: \u201cYo man! Life\u2019s about three things man,\u201d \u201cThree things!\u201d \u201cGettin\u2019 money!\u201d \u201cGettin\u2019 pussy!\u201d \u201cAnd the Dewey Decimal System!\u201d Or\u2026 Um\u2026 Or: \u201cHey! Can you hold my fanny pack I\u2019m gonna go fuck a woman.\u201d [Laughter] + [Applause] Um\u2026 If i could break\u2026 I want to tank you all for being here because I\u2026 I\u2019m so grateful that you\u2019d all come here and spend an hour of your time with me. And if you are watching at home or whatever. On a computer or something. If you have made it this far, That you very much for watching. Genuinely\u2026 I\u2026 This is my favorite thing to do. And I\u2019m so grateful for people watching it and enjoying it. Um\u2026 OK. I will now recede back into my stage persona [Scoffs] [Piano music] I just blacked out for 20 seconds. Thank you for coming. Love songs used to be so beautiful. You know: \u201cLet us go then, you and I.\u201d \u201cWhen the evening is spread out against the sky\u201d \u201clike a patient etherised upon a table\u201d -T. S. Eliot. Beautiful. Love songs now a days Just as beautiful, guys! Usher, Justin Bieber, 1D. You know them. But these new artists they\u2019ve done something very strange to the format of the love song they\u2019ve changed it a bit. And I try to\u2026 capture how they\u2019ve changed the format of the love song with this love song. I hope you enjoy it and mark the differences. Jason Derulo. I love your hair, I love your name, I love the way you say it. I love your heart and you\u2019re so smart cos you gave away it. I love your sis, I love your dad, And I love your mom. But more then all of that I love the fact that you are dumb enough, to not realise everything I\u2019ve said has been said before in a thousand ways in a thousand songs sung with the same four chords. But you\u2019ll still love it and let me finger you. YEAAA! FINGER YOU!! FINGER YOU!!! Oh girl, i hope you don\u2019t think that I\u2019m rude, when I tell you that I love you boo. I also hope that see through this cleverly constructed ruse, designed by a marketing team cashing in on puberty and low self esteem and girls desperate need to feel loved. America says we love a chorus, but don\u2019t get complicated and bore us. Though meaning might be missin\u2019 We need to know the words after just one listen so repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. \u2026repeat stuff. Yeah. Oh you know it? I love my baby and you know I could not live without her. But now I need to make every girl think this song\u2019s about her. Just to make sure that they spread it like the plague. So I describe my dream girl as really really vague, like: I love your hands cos your fingerprints are like no other. I love your eyes and their blueish-brownish-greenish color. I love it when you smile that you smile wide. And I love how your torso has a arm on either side. If you\u2019re my agent, you might be thinking: \u201cOh no!\u201d \u201cSound the alarm!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not appealing\u201d \u201cto little girls\u201d \u201cwho don\u2019t have arms.\u201d But they can\u2019t use iTunes, so\u2026 FUCK them! Who needs them? Oh girl I ho\u2026 Oh! Hello Satan! [Lewd noises] Satan you taste so good! repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. Everybody!

I\u2019m in magazines, full of model teens so far above you. So read them and hate your self. And pay me to tell you I love you. [Gasps: \u201cI love you\u201d] And your parents will always come along. Because their little girl is in love! And how can love be wrong? How can love be wrong? When you repeat stuff\u2026 .repeat stuff.. ..repeat stuff. repeat stuff\u2026 .rep\u2026 [Garbled voice] \u2026I am a vessel\u2026 \u2026.666\u2026 [Garbled voice] \u2026Illuminati\u2026 We know it\u2019s not right. We know it\u2019s not funny. But we\u2019ll stop beating this dead horse when it stops spiting out money. But until then\u2026 We will repeat stuff. [Music end] + [Applause] Thank you so much, you guys have been\u2026 Um\u2026 you guys have been absolutely amazing. You\u2019ve been absolutely amazing. That\u2019s the end of the show. I probably should have ended it on a sort of higher note there. But yeah, that\u2019s the end of \u201cwhat.\u201d I hope you liked it\u2026 [Girl voice] Bo! [Girl voice] Oh my god!

[Guy voice] Alright, we\u2019ve done studies, [Guy voice] young people do not respond [Guy voice] to this, you know, introspective material [Guy voice] these challenges to the form, you know. [Guy voice] Young people want jokes [Guy voice] they can relate to. OK? [Guy voice] So\u2026 Write a\u2026 [Guy voice] Write a silly song about Facebook [Guy voice] you know, write some jokes [Guy voice] about Twitter, [Guy voice] or sugary cereal, [Guy voice] or razor scooters. [Guy voice] Relate to them. [Guy voice] You know, also [Guy voice] you gotta reestablish your presence [Guy voice] on the internet buddy. Alright? [Guy voice] It\u2019s not important weather [Guy voice] the material is good or not. [Guy voice] What\u2019s important is [Guy voice] that you keep the Bo Burnham brand [Guy voice] Alive and well. [Guy voice] You get it? Cool. [Guy voice] We\u2019ll discuss more later [Guy voice] I know it\u2019s a lot. [Guy voice] My number is 310\u2026 555\u2026 [Bro voice] Fag! [Bro voice] What up dude!

An arrogant fucking prick! [Bro voice] I once herd that you [Bro voice] actually act quiet because [Bro voice] you are shy and introverted in real life, [Bro voice] and that people should not expect [Bro voice] you to act the same way [Bro voice] off stage as you do on stage. [Bro voice] Ha ha! Yeah, yeah\u2026 [Bro voice] That makes no sense. [Bro voice] Anyway, you wanna buy some weed? [Girl voice] Bo! Oh my god! [Girl voice] Bo! Oh my god! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo! Bo!

Thank you very much! Thank you all. Oh, wow. That was exciting, wasn\u2019t it? Thank you, guys. Have a seat, feel comfortable, relax. I want to thank everyone in LA for a wonderful week. It\u2019s been great here. You know what? It\u2019s been ten years since the last time I played Los Angeles, if you can imagine. I know! I know, I\u2019ve been gone for a very long time. And unbeknownst to you, it was a difficult ten years. I\u2019m not gonna take you through all the agony I\u2019ve been through, but it was tough. Some of it you might\u2019ve seen.\nI don\u2019t know if you ever saw on TMZ the big headline: \u201cDave Chappelle Drunk Onstage in Detroit.\u201d Well, if you saw it, I wasn\u2019t drunk. I had smoked some reefer\u2026 with some rappers. Yeah. I don\u2019t know if you know anything about hanging out with rappers, but their weed is very strong, stronger than I what I was accustomed to. The article goes on to say I was booed offstage, which is also incorrect. I was booed. I did not leave. It was a long bomb. It was a fucking nightmare. Two puffs of weed, that\u2019s all it was. Two puffs. I never had that happen, where I take two puffs of weed, I looked at the guy next to me, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna bomb, nigga. I can feel it.\u201d And that guy called my name. \u201cDave Chappelle!\u201d Niggas was like\u2026 Normally, when you do a comedy show\u2013 you guys don\u2019t know what it looks like up here, but niggas be just looking up at you like\u2026 That\u2019s how the show started. Didn\u2019t take long for their faces to switch up like, \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d They started looking amongst themselves. So I knew I wasn\u2019t doing good. I don\u2019t remember what I was saying. It just took one person to break the ice. It was a black lady with a Ford Motor shirt on. Stood up suddenly. \u201cFuck you, Dave Chappelle!\u201d I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d She said, \u201cI worked all week for this shit, and this show sucks!\u201d And in a weird act of racial harmony, a conservative white guy stood up and backed her up. \u201cYeah!\u201d The whole crowd banded together and started chanting, \u201cWe want our money back! We want our money back!\u201d I said, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d I snapped out of it. \u201cGood people of Detroit, hear me. Hear me now. You will never get your fucking money back.\u201d Fuck that. I said, \u201cI\u2019m like Evel Knievel. I get paid for the attempt. I didn\u2019t promise this shit would be good.\u201d \u201cBoo!\u201d They said, \u201cFuck you!\u201d\nThis went on for a long time. And then, after the show, I felt so bad, I took half of the money from the show\u2013 thousands of dollars\u2013 I said, \u201cI\u2019m gonna give this to charity.\u201d You know what I did? I bought $25,000 worth of bubble gum and drove around Detroit and handed it out to the homeless so they could chew it and still be hungry. I was very mad at Detroit that night. Because not only did I bomb, I had to go back to the very same room the next night and do it all over again. Fucking nightmare.\nThat would be like if you were having sex with a woman and, for some reason\u2013 this would never happen\u2013 but for some reason, she had a mousetrap in her pussy. You get caught in the trap. And then you\u2019ve got to fuck her again tomorrow night. I\u2019d still do it, but I\u2019d be careful the next time. The old mousetrap-in-the-pussy trick, eh? Fool me once. Yeah. Yeah, it was a tough time. And I wanted to give up sometimes. I almost did give up, but then, right before I gave up, I decided not to. But I made the call. They answered the phone. \u201cHello? Dancing with the Stars.\u201d I said, \u201cNot yet. Not yet.\u201d Yeah. If you see me on that shit, it\u2019s over. Trust me. My spirit is broken. If you see me waiting for them judges\u2026 getting critiqued on my cha-cha, fuck that. I\u2019ve been hanging out in\u2013 I haven\u2019t been working in LA, but I come out here and hang out and shit. I was out here a few weeks ago. I almost got arrested. I\u2019m not bullshitting. This happens to a lot of black people. What happened was\u2026 I was coming out of one of those nightclubs in Hollywood, and my friend saw me. I guess I was wobbling or something. So, he just rolled up. He\u2019s a good friend of mine. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, Dave, give me the keys.\u201d I was like, \u201cAll right, nigga, just take the keys.\u201d And I got in the passenger\u2019s side of my car, and he drove it. It was fine. Just talking, chopping it up. And then, on the 10, the blue-and-whites hit us. Now, I should tell you, the friend that was driving me was black, which really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with the story other than to let you know there was fear in the car. Not my fear. I\u2019m black, but I\u2019m also Dave Chappelle. So, I figured, you know, shit will probably be fine. Traffic stop started off on the right foot. The cops came up to the driver\u2019s side. \u201cHi. How are you guys doing tonight?\u201d And he recognized me immediately. \u201cOh. Dave Chappelle.\u201d And I looked at my friend like, \u201cWe\u2019re getting out of this shit.\u201d And then he says, \u201cYou guys were swerving in the lane. Do you mind just stepping out of the car for a second?\u201d Still no cause for alarm. I looked through the rearview mirror. The body language of the arrest looked good. Just talking. So, then I started fucking with the radio. You know a traffic stop is going good if you\u2019re listening to the radio when someone else is outside of the car. But then, when I looked back in the rearview mirror, something had gone horribly wrong. That motherfucker was back there like\u2026 And the next thing I knew, they were stuffing him in the back of the car, and I thought what anybody would think in a situation like that: \u201cOh, my God. What is gonna happen to me?\u201d And the police walked up to the window. \u201cMr. Chappelle, we had to arrest your friend. He refused to take our breathalyzer test.\u201d I said, \u201cThat motherfucker. Not complying? That\u2019s odd. So, officer, what\u2019s gonna happen to me?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re fine. We\u2019re just gonna have to ask you to step out of the car so we can impound the vehicle, and we\u2019ll arrange for you to have a ride home.\u201d I said, \u201cOh, well, no. I would rather you just give me the keys.\u201d He said, \u201cMr. Chappelle, your friend already told us he\u2019s your designated driver. We can\u2019t let you drive in this condition.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, nigga, I\u2019m good.\u201d And then suddenly, the shit turned into Vegas. He was like\u2026 \u201cI\u2019ll let you blow for it.\u201d I said, \u201cExcuse me?\u201d He said, \u201cIf you blow in my breathalyzer\u2013\u201d I said, \u201cOh, nigga, I thought you was trying to get your dick sucked. What\u2019s the\u2013 Whew! Whew!\u201d \u201cIf you blow in my breathalyzer and pass, I\u2019ll give you the keys to the car.\u201d I said, \u201cUh\u2026 set \u2019em up, nigga. Let\u2019s play.\u201d And I blew in that thing. And it made a noise. \u201cBeep!\u201d I said, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d And he looked at it. He said, \u201cOh, well, Mr. Chappelle, I guess you\u2019re free to go.\u201d I said, \u201cI am?\u201d I didn\u2019t know that thing didn\u2019t pick up weed. I drove home on the miles an hour. Yeah, it all worked out. It all worked out. I\u2019m one of the lucky ones.\nIt doesn\u2019t work out that well for everybody. I saw that videotape of that lady that got beat up in LA in traffic. You see that shit on rush hour traffic? They beat a black woman\u2019s ass. This woman didn\u2019t even do anything wrong. It\u2019s fucked up. It was so fucked up, it didn\u2019t even go to court. The City of L.A. just gave that woman $1.5 million for her pain and suffering. That is not bad, considering that\u2019s the same amount of money that Marcos Maidana made to fight Floyd Mayweather the second time. And this woman obviously hasn\u2019t trained a day in her life. You can see it on the tape. She didn\u2019t come to fight. Her guards were low. She was taking a lot of shots. Everybody\u2019s mad at police now. I watched that\u2013 You see that shit on Netflix, Making a Murderer? The Steven Avery story. If you haven\u2019t seen it, check it out. Steven Avery is in more trouble than any white person in the history of the United States has ever been in! In a justice system designed for him to thrive, he\u2019s failed miserably twice. I can\u2019t even wrap my mind around it. If Making a Murderer was about a black dude, that shit would be called Duh! Of course everything would go wrong. Seems like he did it, all right. The motherfucker even had $200,000 for his legal defense. That should get you off in Wisconsin. That\u2019s like OJ money. All he needed to get off that he didn\u2019t have was a single black juror. That\u2019s all it would\u2019ve took. Because only a black dude in the United States can look at other dudes and be like, \u201cI think the police did this shit.\u201d He\u2019s fucked up in the game. That\u2019s how OJ got off. I\u2019ve been watching that new OJ show. I can\u2019t get enough of that shit. Doesn\u2019t it bring back good memories? But I forgot just how polarizing that OJ case was. And you know, I\u2019ve met OJ Simpson on four different occasions in my life. And before the end of the show, I will tell you about each of those occasions. The first time I met OJ Simpson, I was in Santa Monica. -Santa Monica! -Yeah! I can\u2019t believe a black dude was like, \u201cSanta Monica!\u201d You the last nigga I would expect to say that. Let me see your shoes. You got some Vans on, nigga? What you got? \u201cSanta Monica!\u201d You? At the time, I was . I had done a show, and the guy from the club came up and was like, \u201cHey, OJ Simpson\u2019s here, and he said he wants to meet you.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? Fuck yeah!\u201d I ran down the steps, and OJ was down there. He\u2019s like, \u201cHey, young man. How are you? It\u2019s very good to meet you. And you\u2019re doing really good work, and I hope good things happen for you in your life.\u201d I was like, \u201cMan, thanks, Mr. Juice.\u201d Standing beside him, was\u2013 I don\u2019t know the nice way to say this\u2013 his soon-to-be-slain wife. Ladies and gentlemen, man the fuck up, or you\u2019re not gonna make it to the end of this show. Just man the fuck up. She\u2019s dead. We already know what happened. We don\u2019t know who did it, but we know what happened. I should tell you, that woman was very nice to me. She actually embraced me. She said, \u201cI think you\u2019re adorable,\u201d and she hugged me. She goes, \u201cGood luck to you,\u201d and she held me for a long time. And I whispered in her ear, \u201cBitch, are you trying to get us both killed?\u201d I\u2019m just kidding. I didn\u2019t say that, but\u2026 that was the first time, in a nutshell. It\u2019s good to see so many\u2026 so many different people here from so many different ethnicities. Very diverse crowd. Looks like you thought Bernie Sanders was gonna come out in this motherfucker. But\u2026 surprise! It\u2019s me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I\u2019m happy, really, to see black people come. A lot of black people don\u2019t fuck with me like they used to. But there\u2019s a few reasons you don\u2019t see black people at my shows. One is because, obviously, black people have slower Internet connections. I mean, that would be my guess. I don\u2019t know what\u2013 Actually, my own actions drew a wedge between me and the community I hold so dear. A couple of weeks ago, I was supposed to be in Flint, Michigan, for a charity benefit that was supposed to raise awareness for the appalling condition of the water in Flint. I don\u2019t know if you know this, but the water in Flint is fucking poisonous. It\u2019s actually making people sick. Hollywood people are like, \u201cSo what? At least they have water.\u201d But this water\u2013 this water is fucked up. So, a lot of black celebrities flew into Flint, and they did a tremendous charity benefit, and I was on the schedule to appear.\nUh\u2026 So, the reason a lot of people haven\u2019t heard about this benefit\u2013 it was the same day as the Oscars. Right, I know. So, I was on my way to the airport to go to Flint, and then Chris Rock calls me and is like, \u201cHey, Dave, I got a ticket for you for the Oscars. Can you make it?\u201d And I was like, \u201cSure, nigga. I\u2019m on my way to the airport right now.\u201d Come on, man. What am I gonna do about that water? What am I, a fucking superhero? I need to have fun. I need to live, too! I didn\u2019t fuck that water up! Stevie Wonder was there. They didn\u2019t need me. I\u2019m sorry, everybody. I\u2019d never been to the Oscars. You\u2019ve seen the movies I make. I was excited.\nI knew I was gonna get into some trouble, because when I was walking on the red carpet, the black press came after me. \u201cExcuse me, brother.\u201d When you hear somebody call you \u201cbrother\u201d too much, something terrible is about to happen. \u201cExcuse me, brother. Brother?\u201d And I looked back, and the motherfucker had a tuxedo with the kente cloth tie. I said, \u201cUh-oh.\u201d He said, \u201cI just want to ask you a couple questions.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat publication are you with?\u201d He said, \u201cMe? I\u2019m with The Daily Bongo.\u201d I said, \u201cDaily Bongo? What the fuck? Who the fuck reads this?\u201d He said, \u201cListen, brother, I just want to ask you a quick question. You understand that this year, this is a boycott for the Oscars. So, I\u2019m just wondering what made you, of all people, cross the motherfucking picket line and be here tonight.\u201d I said, \u201cBoycott? Nigga, I haven\u2019t been working in ten years. What do you mean, boycott? I\u2019ve been on strike. Y\u2019all niggas didn\u2019t stop working. I had to watch fucking Key and Peele do my show every night! So, fuck The Daily Bongo,\u201d is what I said. I went to the Oscars and had a wonderful time. I went in that fucking green room. It was filled with so many stars, I couldn\u2019t even believe what I was seeing. Hollywood was seducing me all over again. I was sitting back there. I\u2019m smoking, drinking with the stars.\nAnd then two Hollywood movie producers came over, right to me. \u201cOh, my God. Dave Chappelle,\u201d said the leader one. He was obviously gay. Some guys, you can just tell. The other one seemed like a money guy. Maybe he was from Texas or some shit. But the gay one was definitely the leader because he did all the talking. And then he hit me with: \u201cSo, David, um\u2026 do you have any movie ideas that you would like to pursue?\u201d The truth is, I don\u2019t. But if you know the game, you\u2019re not supposed to tell motherfuckers you don\u2019t have ideas. I was like, \u201cYeah, man. I got plenty of ideas.\u201d And he called my bluff. \u201cReally? Like what?\u201d \u201cHuh? Oh. Um\u2026 um\u2026\u201d\nAnd then I just started making up shit that I thought maybe he\u2019d like to see. I said, \u201cI have a superhero idea.\u201d He goes, \u201cReally?\u201d I go, \u201cYeah. He\u2019s a\u2013 He\u2019s a gay superhero.\u201d He was like, \u201cReally?! What\u2019s it called?\u201d \u201cHuh? Oh, it\u2019s called\u2013 It\u2019s called Same Hero, New Boots. It\u2019s about a gay sous-chef in San Francisco\u2026 that gets bit by a radioactive rat on his shift when he\u2019s taking out the trash and is blessed with powers beyond his wildest dreams, supersonic gay kind of powers. And he starts saving everybody in San Francisco. But at first, he only saves gay people. Later, he saves everybody, and the whole city just falls in love with him. The only problem is, no one remembers him when he saves them.\u201d \u201cWell, I don\u2019t understand. Why wouldn\u2019t they remember him?\u201d I said, \u201cBecause, dummy, he\u2019s gay. He keeps changing his outfit. People come up\u2013 \u2018Thanks for saving me, sir. What\u2019s your name anyway?\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018Same Hero, New Boots!\u2019 And that motherfucker flies away.\u201d\nHe was like, \u201cI like it a lot.\u201d The Texan didn\u2019t like that shit at all. He was upset. \u201cThat\u2019s impossible, a gay superhero.\u201d I said, \u201cWhat? Well, I have others. I have a superhero you\u2019d love, \u2019cause he\u2019s stronger than Superman and he fights for truth, justice and the American way, like Superman, but more than Superman. He beats up Mexicans for no reason.\u201d The Texan\u2019s like, \u201cYou got my attention.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, this motherfucker\u2019s so strong, he can fly and do all this great shit. Only problem with this guy is he can\u2019t even activate his powers unless he touches\u2013 unless he touches a woman\u2019s vagina. Not a long touch, just a couple of pats.\u201d He said, \u201cWell, what\u2019s the problem with that?\u201d I said, \u201cThe problem, sir, is that our hero is not a handsome man. And he\u2019s often short on cash. So, whenever trouble breaks out, he has to run around the city and convince women to let him pat their vaginas. \u2018Please, miss! That building\u2019s on fire. Can I pat your vagina? Quickly. People are dying!\u2019 But he can\u2019t tell them exactly why. \u2018Eww! Get away! You\u2019re gross!\u2019 \u2018Please, miss! People are dying! Just a couple of pats!\u2019 \u2018Eww! Gross! Get away!\u2019 So, he rapes them.\nI know, I know. That\u2019s the dilemma for the audience. Because he rapes, but he saves a lot of lives. And he saves way more than he rapes, and he only rapes to save. But he does rape.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize it, but the whole green room was looking at us. All the celebrities were disgusted. \u201cOhh.\u201d That guy from Texas was like, \u201cHere\u2019s my card. Call me on Monday.\u201d That worked out. The second time I met OJ Simpson. It was right after the trial of the century. There I was, now a young man of probably 23. OJ Simpson was the most famous, or infamous, face on planet Earth. I was in a restaurant in Beverly Hills with my agents. I wasn\u2019t alone in the restaurant, but I was alone. I was the only black person in the restaurant. And in the 90\u2019s, that felt very uncomfortable. Now I tend to enjoy it at this age. I was having dinner with my agents, celebrating a deal that they told me was lucrative, but I later learned fucking sucked. And suddenly, a group of women walked by. Every race was in that group. Black, white, Asian, Latina, white, white\u2026 and white again. They were all gorgeous. I watched them walk by. Then I saw a familiar face. Al Cowlings, the man from the infamous Bronco chase, walked by and embraced one of the women, and they walked towards the door. Couldn\u2019t believe what I saw. And then, close behind him, was OJ Simpson, newly released from jail. The restaurant fell still. I was shocked. I didn\u2019t mean to say it out loud, but it just came out. \u201cOJ!\u201d He stopped, turned around to see who said it, saw my black face and correctly assumed it was me. I was sitting in the corner of the booth. He leaned over all the white people I was having dinner with and shook my hand. \u201cHow are you, young man?\u201d He looked in my eyes, and I could see in his eyes that he didn\u2019t remember meeting me the first time. And then he walked away. And I looked back at my agents, and all of them had nothing short of disgust on their faces. And the only one with the courage to voice their disgust was a woman named Sharon who used to represent me. \u201cHow could you?\u201d she said. \u201cHow could you shake hands with that murderer?\u201d I said, \u201cSharon, with all due respect, that murderer ran for over 11,000 yards. And he was acquitted. So, you know, fuck it. The glove didn\u2019t fit. The glove didn\u2019t fit. Get over yourself.\u201d Some people can\u2019t do that. Some people just can\u2019t get over themselves. Gay people have a hard time doing that recently. Here we go. Here comes the deep water. No, recently I\u2019ve noticed that. I noticed it with that Manny Pacquiao controversy. Yeah, it was\u2013 Now, in the gay community\u2019s defense, Manny Pacquiao said some outlandish shit about gay people, very not nice things that I won\u2019t repeat, but there was biblical verses and some analogies to animals. It wasn\u2019t a good look. Nike took his shoes immediately. Which I thought was a little harsh. A little harsh, you know what I mean? Just \u2019cause he\u2019s Asian. You know what I mean? How the fuck are you gonna take the shoes off an Asian dude to appease a gay dude? You know what I mean? No? You don\u2019t know what I mean. But Asian people kind of know what I mean. No? No Asians in the front? No? No, this is what I mean. Look, you\u2019re an Asian dude\u2013 I say this with no disrespect.\nWe\u2019re all Americans, right? And we can agree that America has a huge body count all over the world, but nowhere more than Asia. Literally, if you look at history, recently, we have bombed the masculinity out of an entire continent. We dropped two atomic bombs on fucking Japan, and they\u2019ve been drawing Hello Kitty and shit ever since. There\u2019s a lot of lady-boys in the wake of our bombs. And I know these things because my wife is Asian. She\u2019s Filipino. All right, okay. So, that explains it. Now you know why you see me at all those Filipino events. I\u2019m not there picking up pussy. I\u2019m dropping some off. I take my wife to all that shit. I took my wife to see Pacquiao fight Mayweather. We sat ringside, okay? That\u2013 Yeah, that was a quiet car ride home, that\u2019s what that was.\nBut if you know what\u2019s popping in the Philippines, you know that they got a whole generation of kids in the Philippines growing up without their mothers. Yes. A lot of women in the Philippines go to the Arabian Peninsula, they come to the United States, they make all their money here, they send all that money back home, which is still one of the number-one staples in the Philippines\u2019 economy\u2013 money that the expats send back to the Philippines. The men, on the other hand, are left rearing children, twiddling their thumbs, waiting on their wives\u2019 checks. These men have been fucking emasculated.\nAnd then suddenly, a boxer rises from amongst them and reinstates their manhood with his motherfucking fist. This is not the guy you\u2019re supposed to ask, \u201cWhat do you think of homosexuals?\u201d He\u2019s not your champ. Shit. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have a sneaker deal, \u2019cause if you say something that people don\u2019t like, they\u2019ll take your fucking shoes off.\nIf Martin Luther King had a sneaker deal, we\u2019d still be on the back of the bus. It\u2019s true. The Nike exec would come up\u2013 \u201cHi, Martin. Uh\u2026 we need you to tone down the talk of civil rights and blacks being humans. It\u2019s upsetting our Southern distributors.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t understand. I thought that\u2019s why I had a sneaker deal in the first place.\u201d \u201cNot quite. Really, it\u2019s a walking shoe. And we like the marching, but\u2026 Try to understand.\u201d Fuck that shit.\nYou know, I get it, though. I understand why gay people are mad, and I empathize. You know what? I\u2019m just telling you this as a black dude. I support your movement. But if you want to take some advice from a Negro, pace yourself. These things take a while. Just \u2019cause they passed the law doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re gonna like it. Brown v. Board of Education was in. Somebody called me a nigger in traffic last Wednesday. It takes a minute. My wife\u2019s friend Stewart told me that. My wife has a lot of gay friends. Stewart\u2019s their leader. She has a lot of gay friends. And I don\u2019t like \u2019em. Not \u2019cause they\u2019re gay. I\u2019m just judging them on the merits of their character. They\u2019re just not nice dudes. They\u2019re fucking rude houseguests. They\u2019re sitting on my couch, giggling with my wife, eating my motherfucking macaroons. Then I come in, and they act like the party\u2019s over. \u201cHey, Stewart. What\u2019s going on?\u201d This guy talks to me the way a cat would speak if a cat could talk. \u201cHi, David.\u201d \u201cStewart, what\u2019s all the beef, man? What\u2019s going\u2013\u201d He always wants to have some kind of gay political argument. The last one was about a petition in federal court to take the words \u201chusband and wife\u201d out of the law. I said, \u201cWhy would you want those words out of the law?\u201d He said, \u201cBecause it discriminates against same-sex couples.\u201d I was like, \u201cNiggas, please, save me the semantics. Just trust me. Take your chips and get the fuck out of the casino. You\u2019re about to crap out! Just go outside, talk that over amongst yourselves, and whichever one of you is gayer, that\u2019s the wife.\u201d No, no. Stewart didn\u2019t like that. Stewart educates me about this movement. I didn\u2019t even know shit about it. He told me it\u2019s called \u201cLBGTQ!\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat the fuck is the \u2018Q\u2019?\u201d Does that even make sense? \u201cQ\u201d? Turns out \u201cQ\u201d is like the vowels. That shit is sometimes \u201cY.\u201d It\u2019s for gay dudes that don\u2019t really know they\u2019re gay. Like prison fags who are like, \u201cWhat? I\u2019m not gay, nigga. I\u2019m just sucking these dicks to pass the time. I\u2019m not \u2018G.\u2019 I\u2019m \u2018Q.\u2019 Ugh.\u201d I think\u2013 Okay, again, of all those letters, the \u201cT\u201d has the toughest road ahead. In fact, I think the \u201cT\u201d should stand for \u201cTough road ahead.\u201d They\u2019ve got the longest mental gap to bridge. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. Because whenever I see one of them Ts on the street, I don\u2019t mind them, but I\u2019ll be like, \u201cMan, I miss Bruce.\u201d I\u2019m sorry, guys. I\u2019m 42. I remember Bruce Jenner. Before the Kardashians, before all that, this motherfucker was a white American superhero. It was amazing. He was beating Africans at track and field. We\u2019d never seen anything like it. He was on my cereal box growing up. You know how much of that cereal I ate? Nigga, I didn\u2019t know he was gonna do that. I knew before you guys knew. I heard things on the street in Hollywood. You\u2019d just be out, see people. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, Kanye? Why the long face?\u201d \u201cNigga, you\u2019ll see. I got two mother-in-laws now.\u201d And when I heard he was gonna do it, I was scared. I didn\u2019t think the public was ready. I didn\u2019t think the media was ready. And you know what? I was wrong. Not only did the public embrace him, but the media was nice. I\u2019d never seen anything like it. \u201cWelcome to the world, Caitlyn. So long, Bruce. Hello, Caitlyn.\u201d I was shocked! Is this happening?\nWait a minute. Is this a time in American history where an American can make a decision for themselves, and even though other Americans don\u2019t understand it, they\u2019ll support it and let this person live a happy life? Is this what\u2019s happening? If it is, then good for America. That\u2019s Dave Chappelle, the American. Although, Dave Chappelle, the black American, he was a little jealous. I was like, \u201cHow the fuck are transgender people beating black people in the discrimination Olympics?\u201d If the police shot half as many transgenders as they did niggas last year, there\u2019d be a fucking war in LA. I know black dudes in Brooklyn\u2013 hard street motherfuckers\u2013 that wear high heels just to feel safe. Transgenders are gangsters. I used to do business with a transgender in Hollywood. Man, everybody would be scared of her in the boardroom. She\u2019d walk in there, newly-minted woman, high heels, purse. Wouldn\u2019t say anything to us, just walk around the conference table, looking mean and shit. Then she\u2019d walk to the head of the conference table, stare at us all, reach in her purse, pull her old dick out and throw it on the table. \u201cLet\u2019s talk business, gentlemen.\u201d \u201cAaah!\u201d Shit is scary as fuck. If your best friend pitched that to you, you\u2019d be horrified. \u201cYo, nigga, let\u2019s go to the hospital and cut our dicks off and make pussies out of them shits.\u201d \u201cWhat?! Can\u2019t we just get matching jackets or tattoos or something? You sure that\u2019s what you want to do?\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s only way to find out, nigga. Wu-Tang! Pow! Pow! Let\u2019s go to the club and trick niggas into fucking us. Yeah.\u201d The third time I met OJ Simpson\u2014 The third time I met OJ Simpson, I was doing great in life. I\u2019d just finished the second season of Chappelle\u2019s Show. Man, those were good days. I was playing a comedy club in Miami, The Improv. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been, but if you have, you\u2019d know the door for the green room is right on the stage. Can you imagine such a thing? If I walked out of the door of the green room, bam, I was right here, right from the dressing room. And I did that. I walked out, and the whole crowd was like, \u201cHooray!\u201d And I looked\u2013 ma\u2019am, as close as you are to me\u2013 I saw him as soon as I came out: The Juice. And I saw recognition in his eyes, and it filled me with pride that he knew who I was. I didn\u2019t acknowledge his presence because it was a white audience, and I didn\u2019t want to start a panic. But I did my show. The show went great. I said, \u201cGood night, everyone.\u201d They all said, \u201cYay!\u201d And I didn\u2019t say nothing to OJ, but I just gave him the signal to let him know I knew he was there. And I walked into the green room, and OJ was already in there! I was like, \u201cHow the fuck is this possible?\u201d I was scared. And then my friends came in, and we all started talking. We sat down on the couch. And I\u2019m just telling you what I saw with my own eyes. You can believe me or not believe me. But in my experience, OJ Simpson\u2013 one of the nicest men I\u2019d ever met. He was nice to me. He was nice to my friends. The conversation was filled with warmth and levity, humor and wisdom. We talked for minutes, and then suddenly, the Juice said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019ve got to be going. But it\u2019s good to see you again, and I\u2019m glad things went so well.\u201d I said, \u201cThanks, Juice.\u201d And my friends said, \u201cYeah, goodbye, Mr. Juice.\u201d They were new to the game. He said, \u201cNo. Thank you\u2026 for your hospitality. Good night, guys.\u201c And we said, \u201cGood night.\u201d And he just walked out of the room. And as soon as the door closed, we all looked at each other like, \u201cThat nigga did that shit. Did you feel that? I could feel like\u2026 murder in the room.\u201d Well, you young heads missed that shit. You\u2019re all too young. You don\u2019t remember that. -How old are you, young, man? You. -Twenty-four. Twenty-four? You don\u2019t know shit. You don\u2019t know shit! You gotta Google shit that I lived through. See, this is why I lock motherfuckers\u2019 phones up. Seriously. Because the young kids, you guys need to take a break from that\u2013 We all need to break just from that technology, just for a minute. You know, I\u2019m from a different time, young man. A dark time to you. I\u2019m from a time that I didn\u2019t even used to know who was on the phone until I answered the shit. Like, when tragedy used to strike.\nI remember I was 12 years old, and the teacher wheeled a television set into the classroom. You remember these days? And she turned it on to one of three channels. And she said, \u201cClass, the space shuttle is taking off, and we\u2019re all gonna watch it take off.\u201d Man, that shit was going great for like, three to five minutes. That\u2019s right. You remember. It fucking exploded! Right on television. Everybody on board, dead. Immediately presumed dead. It was so bad, the teacher looked at all the kids and was like\u2026 \u201cYou can go home.\u201d It was a goddamn national tragedy. This was Cold War America. The Russians were laughing at us. My point is, for a guy your age wouldn\u2019t even know the pain, because in your generation, it\u2019s like the space shuttle blows up every fucking day. How can you care about anything when you know every goddamn thing? I\u2019m getting over one cop shooting, and then another one happens, and then another one happens, and another one happens. I\u2019m crying about Paris, and then Brussels happens. I can\u2019t keep track of all this shit. So you just give the fuck up. That\u2019s the hallmark of your generation, and that\u2019s fucked up, because your generation lives in the most difficult time in human history. This is the age of spin. The age where nobody knows what the fuck they\u2019re even looking at. Did you know that Planned Parenthood was for abortions? It\u2019s for people that don\u2019t plan things out at all. That\u2019s right. So, a guy your age doesn\u2019t really know how he feels. Are you pro-choice? Are you anti-consequences? What does it all really mean? It\u2019s easier not to care for you. But for us, we were trained to care. We were raised that way. I used to watch a fucking cartoon when I was growing up called Care Bears. It was about a fucking group of teddy-bear people. They were like teddy bears, but they were like people, and they were all different colors, and they all fucking just walked around, caring. They cared about each other and everything else. They all had different designs on their stomachs, and the designs told you something about what they might be like inside. Very, very loving group of beings. And when shit got real bad, as nice as those teddy bears were, they didn\u2019t get mean faces. They got determined. Hmm! And the leader would say, \u201cCome on, guys. It\u2019s time for the Care Bear Stare!\u201d Remember that shit? And them little teddy bears would lock arms\u2026 and stare at the problem\u2013 and I\u2019m not even bullshitting\u2013 actual love would shoot out of their chests\u2026 and would dispel anything that was fucked up. And when we grew up, we wanted to be like those bears. And then we got our hearts broken, because we found out that life wasn\u2019t gonna let us do that and that it\u2019s impossible to shoot love out of your chest. However, I have shot love onto somebody\u2019s chest before. I do it all the time. It\u2019s the next best thing. You kids don\u2019t know. Your generation is just determined to be angry, mad. Everybody\u2019s mad. Back when we were growing up, only black people were mad. Now everybody\u2019s just trying to get in on the act. I try to think to myself, \u201cWhen did everyone get mad?\u201d And then I realize this happened before we were born. This is a long way to go, but\u2026 it probably started in the Second World War. Think about it. All these black men, millions of black men, leave the United States for the first time, go over to Europe with America\u2019s Armed Forces and fight the Nazis and make more money fighting Nazis than they ever dreamed they would make in the United States. And a lot of those men, while they were in Europe\u2013 just to be real, not to be crass\u2013 a lot of them probably got their dicks sucked by white women. I\u2019m sorry, ladies and gentlemen. This was World War II Europe, and these were desperate times, and penises were being sucked for shoelaces and chocolate and very frivolous things. And it\u2019s very hard to come back to America and sit on the back of the bus after you\u2019ve been in the South of France, getting your dick sucked for a Crunch bar or some crazy shit like that. That\u2019s a life-changing experience. And while that was happening in Europe, here in America, for the first time, women entered the workforce en masse, by the millions. All the men were gone. Someone had to run the factory. The ladies did it. That\u2019s right. This was the first generation of American women to have independent income en masse, and when the men came back, the women weren\u2019t the same. American women had grown. They were uttering phrases that no woman on Earth had ever spoken before, things like, \u201cNo\u201d and \u201cShut the fuck up\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t feel like it.\u201d\nAnd then behind the scenes of that, there was a little-known government agency that started testing mind control drugs on the American public. They fucked up. They tested it for 12 years. They didn\u2019t realize these drugs were not mind-controlling. They were mind-expanding. It was LSD and mescaline and shit like that. And for the first time, there was a new school of thought that was chemically induced that made people question the very society they lived in. By 1960, the President of the United States was only 42 years old. Can you imagine? DMX is older than that. And he was gonna usher in a new era of peace. He was gonna avoid the Cold War. He was gonna end segregation. And they blew his fucking brains out in front of everyone in Dallas. This country was never the same. There were seven more major assassinations in the \u201960s. Anyone that stood up and said anything was shot down in the streets like a fucking dog. Kennedy, Kennedy, King, X, Evers, on and on. You didn\u2019t even have to be famous. You could be a college student at Kent State, or in Mississippi, protesting the Vietnam War, and they shot them, too. The \u201970s were a wild era. And while all this was going on\u2026 Bill Cosby raped 54 people. Holy shit. That\u2019s a lot of rapes, man. This guy\u2019s putting up real numbers. He\u2019s like the Steph Curry of rape. Man, that\u2019s a lot of rapes. Fifty-four? If he had raped less people\u2026 that\u2019s still two dozen rapes! Don\u2019t forget, each one of these rapes has eight hours of sleep in it. Ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s over hours of rape. It only takes hours to get a pilot\u2019s license. If rapes were aircrafts, this nigga is Top Gun for sure.\nYeah, that\u2019s a tough one. And I was onstage not too long ago. I was in Syracuse, New York. Yeah. Well, yeah, for Syracuse. But the show didn\u2019t go so good\u2026 all because I was talking about Bill Cosby a little bit. Not a little bit. I\u2019ll be honest. I talked about him for like, minutes. And a woman stood up in the back of the room, and she screamed out, \u201cYou are a fucking asshole for saying these things!\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d Instantly, I felt bad. Not bad about what I was saying. I just felt bad like, \u201cOh, that\u2019s too bad she doesn\u2019t like the show.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize it at first, but not only did she say that, she was rushing the stage. By the time I saw her, I just saw this shadowy figure fucking charging up the aisle towards me in full fight mode. I was horrified. I said, \u201cOh, my God! I\u2019m gonna kick this bitch in the face.\u201d Lucky for me, I didn\u2019t have to. Security tackled her. But it was a really fucking horrifying scene. A scuffle ensued. And then, finally, she screamed out to me, \u201cWomen suffer!\u201d I said, \u201cI know.\u201d And, ladies, I need you to know\u2026 that I know. I need you to know. Seriously, there\u2019s a lot of men in this room that identify themselves as feminists. I would include myself in that. Don\u2019t ever forget, we all have mothers and daughters and sisters and wives, and we want to see all these women do well and not be held back by their gender. There\u2019s a lot of men like that in this room. There\u2019s a lot of men like that in the world. Or as we are known on the streets, bitch-ass niggas. But as this woman was wrestling and screaming at me, I started to take offense. And I\u2019ll be honest, race was involved. She was a young white woman. Well-intentioned, but just not thinking it all the way through. \u201cBitch, how the fuck are you going to yell at a black man about discrimination?\u201d She didn\u2019t get it. She just kept going. \u201cWomen suffer!\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d \u201cWomen suffer!\u201d \u201cSame team.\u201d \u201cWomen suffer!\u201d \u201cI know.\u201d And this is when she went too far: \u201cWe suffer just like you.\u201d \u201cSlow your roll, bitch. You suffer, yes, but not like me. Not like us.\u201d She goes, \u201cSuffering is suffering. What\u2019s the difference?\u201d I said, \u201cCome on, white woman, you know what it is. You was in on the heist. You just don\u2019t like your cut.\u201d You suffer, I suffer. You suffer, I suffer. That\u2019s how it works.\nCan\u2019t do comparative suffering. If you\u2019re hungry, and your friend says, \u201cYou know, people are starving in Africa,\u201d \u201cSo what, nigga? I still want lunch.\u201d Black people know about comparative suffering, and you know that it\u2019s a fucking dead-end game. Blacks and Jews do that shit to each other all the time. You ever played Who Suffered More with a Jewish person? It\u2019s a tough game. Whenever you think you\u2019ve got the Jewish guy on the ropes, that motherfucker will be like, \u201cWell, don\u2019t forget about Egypt.\u201d \u201cEgypt?! God damn, nigga, I didn\u2019t know we was going all the way back to Egypt.\u201d What the fuck is wrong with her? What does she think? Does she think that I don\u2019t know that rape is wrong? Does she think that maybe I don\u2019t have empathy for Bill Cosby\u2019s alleged victims? And I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t remind you that technically these are all still allegations. Although, I admit it looks very bad. Perhaps if she looked at it correctly, she would have empathy for me, the man she was attacking, a 42-year-old black comedian.\nObviously, Bill Cosby was a hero to me. And she doesn\u2019t know what it feels like to think that your hero might\u2019ve done something so heinous, my God, you can\u2019t imagine. It\u2019d be as if you heard that chocolate ice cream itself\u2026 had raped 54 people. You\u2019d say to yourself, \u201cOh, man, but I like chocolate ice cream. I don\u2019t want it to rape.\u201d Didn\u2019t want to believe it. At first, I didn\u2019t believe it. I said, \u201cThese people are obviously trying to destroy Dr. Cosby\u2019s rich legacy.\u201d Even 34 allegations into it, I was still like, \u201cMan\u2026 he probably only raped ten or 11 of those people.\u201d I know, I know. But it\u2019s really tough. You guys are young. Imagine if you found out 40 years from now that Kevin Hart raped 54 people. You\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d The only one that would believe that would be Katt Williams. He\u2019d be like, \u201cI knew that motherfucker was up to something! I knew Kevin had raped those people.\u201d You know, I was mad at Kevin, too, though. You know why? Okay, first of all, I didn\u2019t even know Kevin was as successful as he was. I found that shit out the hard way. I was at home when my son busted in. He said, \u201cDad, I need $250.\u201d He\u2019s only years old, so I freaked out. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on, nigga? Is somebody trying to kill you?\u201d He said, \u201cNo, no. Kevin Hart\u2019s coming to town, and I wanted to see his show.\u201d I said, \u201cHow much are the tickets?\u201d He said, \u201cThey\u2019re $125.\u201d I said, \u201cGod damn! Mine are only 80.\u201d I said, \u201cWhy do you need $250, then?\u201d He goes, \u201cBecause I want to go with you, Dad. Please? And there it is. So, I took him to the show. And we go, we sit right up front. The lights go down, and one opening act after another goes on. Then Kevin takes the stage. The crowd goes fucking nuts. Thousands of people. I was furious. The longer the show went on, the madder I got. Because his show was fucking outstanding. It was maddening. These people were fucking holding their stomachs. My son was slapping his knee. I\u2019m like, \u201cDamn, nigga, I do this, too.\u201d Kevin says, \u201cGood night.\u201d The crowd goes crazy. And then everyone starts walking to his door, and the lights come on, and then my son is just standing there, looking at an empty stage. People are pushing past me, and nobody\u2019s recognizing me. I\u2019m like, \u201cMan, this place fucking sucks!\u201d I said, \u201cCome on, son, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Then my son looks back at me and says, \u201cDad, please. Please, I have to meet him.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, my God.\u201d So, I took him backstage. I\u2019ve known Kevin for years, but can you believe I was scared to knock on his dressing room door? I almost said\u2026 \u201cSon, I haven\u2019t seen him for a long time.\u201d And one of Kevin\u2019s goons opened the door. \u201cHey, what\u2019s up, Dave Chappelle? What are you doing, man? It\u2019s good to see you, brother. What are you doing in this area? This is a terrible area.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cActually, I live around here. Listen\u2026 is Kevin here? My son just wanted to meet him real quick.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know, \u2019cause Kevin\u2019s about to eat dinner.\u201d Just then, Kevin came around the corner to see who it was. \u201cWhat? Oh, shit! What\u2019s up, Dave? Come on back. I was just about to have dinner. I don\u2019t know if you guys ate, but you\u2019re welcome to join me if you\u2019d like.\u201d And then my son pushed passed me. It was some cold shit. He goes, \u201cActually, Mr. Hart, we haven\u2019t eaten in several hours.\u201d Man, Kevin took us into his back room. This guy had a fucking spread. It was Tuesday night. This motherfucker was having Sunday dinner. There were steaks, chops, corn with butter all over it. My son was eating all fast, embarrassing me. I was like, \u201cSlow down, son.\u201d He was like\u2026 Then I looked over in the corner, and there was a box of custom-made jerseys for the local team. Each one was hand-stitched, and on the back, they stitched on \u201cK-Hart\u201d on all of them. Kevin saw me staring at that box, and he went over and grabbed one of them jerseys, and he walked right to my son. He said, \u201cHey, little man. I want you to have this.\u201d And my son was like, \u201cThanks, Mr. Hart.\u201d This is when I got mad. He goes, \u201cIf your father ever makes you mad, put that on.\u201d And he walked out. Oh, that was some cold shit. Then I realized\u2013 I looked up what Kevin made on Google. I couldn\u2019t believe that shit. Kevin is the first comedian that a Drake song could be about. Kevin could walk around his house and sing \u201cAll Me,\u201d and the whole song would still be true. \u201c\u266a Got everything, I got everything \u266a \u266a I cannot complain, I cannot \u266a \u266a I don\u2019t even know How much I really made \u266a \u266a I forgot, it\u2019s a lot \u266a \u266a Fuck that, never mind what I got \u266a\u201d And his wife will be like, \u201cKevin, come to bed!\u201d He\u2019ll be like\u2026 \u201c\u266a Ho, shut the fuck up \u266a \u266a I got way too much\u2013 \u266a\u201d You know how much money you have to have to tell a girl to shut the fuck up? I have \u201cQuiet, please\u201d money at best. I\u2019d have to take a loan out for \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201d \u201cShut the fuck up\u2013\u201d That\u2019s Jay Z money. And Beyonc\u00e9 got \u201cNo, you shut the fuck up\u201d money. Let\u2019s not forget. Let\u2019s not forget. I\u2019ve never met Bill Cosby, so I\u2019m not defending him. Let\u2019s just remember that he has a valuable legacy that I can\u2019t just throw away. I remember that he\u2019s the first black man to ever win an Emmy in television. I also remember that he\u2019s the first guy to make a cartoon with black characters where their lips and noses were drawn proportionately. I remember that he had a television show that got numbers equivalent to the Super Bowl every Thursday night. And I remember that he partnered up with a clinical psychologist to make sure that there was not one negative image of African-Americans on his show. I\u2019m telling you, that\u2019s no small thing. I\u2019ve had a television show. I wouldn\u2019t have done that shit. He gave tens of millions of dollars to African-American institutions of higher learning, and is directly responsible for thousands of black kids going to college. Not just the ones he raped. Here comes the kicker. You ready? Here\u2019s the fact that I heard, but haven\u2019t confirmed. I heard that when Martin Luther King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial and said he had a dream, he was speaking into a PA system that Bill Cosby paid for. So, you understand what I\u2019m saying? The point is this: He rapes, but he saves. And he saves more than he rapes. But he probably does rape. Thank you very much! Good night! \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto \u266a \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto \u266a \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto \u266a \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto \u266a Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! I forgot. The fourth time I met OJ Simpson. The fourth time is not the funniest time, but it was the last time I\u2019d see the Juice. For some reason, I was at the Kentucky Derby. It\u2019s a very long story. This is right after I quit Chappelle\u2019s Show in spectacular fashion. There was a party hosted by Michael Jordan, and every athlete I\u2019ve ever admired was in that room. Yes. And then I saw a familiar face by the bar, standing there, drinking alone. It was Chris Tucker. Now\u2026 you have to remember, at this time, we were both technically missing. And we went over, and we\u2019re talking with one another, and motherfuckers were amazed to see us together. Seeing me and Chris Tucker at that point would be like seeing Bigfoot riding a unicorn. You wouldn\u2019t believe that\u2019s what you were seeing. And then, through all the gawkers, a familiar face pushed through the crowd. Here he was again. The Juice. He had his camera ready. He was like, \u201cDave, Chris. Good to see you guys. Hey, come on, guys. Let\u2019s all get together for a picture.\u201d And at the same time, me and Chris were like, \u201cNo. I can\u2019t do that. Sorry, Juice, my career is too flimsy to survive a picture with you.\u201d That\u2019s the end. Good night. \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto \u266a \u266a Ah-ah \u266a \u266a Revolution \u266a \u266a Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah \u266a \u266a In every ghetto\u2026 \u266a One last thing. Before you go, I just wanted to acknowledge for the real comedy fans. We can\u2019t not acknowledge it. We lost a fucking juggernaut in comedy this week. So, I\u2019m just shouting out the family and friends of Garry Shandling. Much love to you guys. My sincerest condolences. And for the hip-hop fans in the building\u2026 put two fingers up in the air for A Tribe Called Quest and my man Phife Dawg. May he rest in peace forever and ever. Thank you for that beautiful music. Good night, everybody. Thank you. Twos up! Twos up! Hands up, hands up! Twos up! We\u2019re gonna do this for Phife!

Davis, what\u2019s up? I\u2019m home. I had to bring it back here. Netflix said, \u201cWhere do you want to do the special? LA, Chicago, New York?\u201d I was like, \u201cNah, son. Davis California.\u201d [cheering, whooping] This has, um\u2026 This has been a very good year for me. I recently got married, you guys. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. I need the claps. It\u2019s a very heavy ring. Very heavy. It was a reverse Lord of the Rings situation. I got a ring and then lost my powers, which is a very different Lord of the Rings. \u201cListening? Compromise? Take the ring, Sam.\u201d The movie is done in eight minutes. It\u2019s not a 90-hour saga. We just celebrated our one-year anniversary, so it\u2019s one year down, forever to go. Which is terrifying to say. But you know what\u2019s great? Now, it\u2019s just kind of liberating. Because I don\u2019t give a fuck about any of my single friends. I don\u2019t care about any of you and it feels great. Because you guys are at home, just swiping for love, and complaining. \u201cOh, how do you find people?\u201d \u201cDimples? Off with his head!\u201d Like a god-damn emperor. \u201cBrunettes? Not for me.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYou work at Subway. You don\u2019t deserve so much choice.\u201d We\u2019re getting soft. You realize my parents physically never saw each other? Thirty years ago in a town in India, population 990,000 \u2013 that\u2019s a small town \u2013 my dad heard a buzz in the streets about this woman named Seema, my mom. And, like, Seema was that chick, you guys. In \u201982, Seema could get\u2026 Look at that red langa. Killing it! She was like the iPhone 8. \u201cHave you heard of Seema? She\u2019s slim. Her family owns a camera.\u201d My dad was like, \u201cA camera?\u201d So he runs to my grandfather\u2019s house and lays it on the line. \u201cI\u2019m going to America. I want to marry Seema. YOLO.\u201d In ten minutes, the man married a woman he had never laid eyes on. You understand? That\u2019s Tinder with no photos. [laughter] \u201cI want that for the rest of my life. I hope she has a good personality. Let\u2019s move to the US where we\u2019re the only people that know each other.\u201d I\u2019m so grateful for that decision. Najmi marries Question Mark, they come to the States, I come out. Popping out of your mom is like real estate. It\u2019s all about location. I popped out here. Anybody brown, we popped out here, we made it. We\u2019re the rappers that made it. What\u2019s wild is, I never even knew how the whole X-Men Origins story went down. It\u2019s crazy, because we know nothing about our parents and our parents know nothing about us. \u201cDad, your favorite color?\u201d \u201cStanford!\u201d \u201cWhat? No.\u201d \u201cNo, I want to know more about you.\u201d \u201cWhy? Get into Stanford.\u201d\nAnd I think it\u2019s just that, like, immigrants love secrets. Right? They love them. They love bottling them up deep down, and unleashing them on you later when it\u2019s no longer relevant. \u201cMom\u2019s a ninja, Dad\u2019s a communist? Why are you telling me this right now?\u201d Every conversation with my dad is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It\u2019s just 90 minutes of build-up to no payoff. [laughs and applause] \u201cThat\u2019s the ending?\u201d\nSo my dad marries my mom, they come to the States, they have me, in Davis, California, but my mom has to go back to India to finish up med school. So the first eight years, it was just me and my dad. Just the two of us trying to make it in America. Minus all the unconditional love. Brown love is very conditional. In the photo he\u2019s like, \u201cYou had better get all As.\u201d Like, let\u2019s be real. I grew up here. Like, Pioneer\u2026 I grew up here. Yeah. [huge cheer] But Davis was, like, super white. Kind of like tonight. [laughter]\nRoll call was a problem. It was a big deal for a lot of us. \u2013 Like, what\u2019s your name? \u2013 Jasura. Okay. What would you get? \u2013 Jasuriah. \u2013 Jasuriah? Yeah. I would get, like, \u201cHanson Minaja\u2026\u201d \u201cSahan Minha.\u201d \u201cSaddam Hussein.\u201d It was my English teacher. \u201cI\u2019m not Saddam.\u201d \u2013 What\u2019s your name? \u2013 Biju. \u2013 What would you get? \u2013 A blank stare. A blank stare? I\u2019m the only brown kid at school, Dad is the only brown guy at work. In a weird way that brings us together, and we have to do everything together. Try to understand immigrant fathers.\nI still can\u2019t understand some of you. There are uncles here. None of you guys are smiling. I don\u2019t get it. You\u2019re going to die. Laugh. Why aren\u2019t you laughing? You\u2019re always stressed and always tired. You could wake up any immigrant father from a 12-hour nap, and they\u2019d say\u2026 [angry yawn] \u201cWhy do I have to pay taxes?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cJesus\u2026\u201d We\u2019d do everything\u2026\nI remember being in the grocery store. And we\u2019d be walking through the aisles, and my dad would pick up yogurt. \u201cAh, yogurt.\u201d Or milk. Just like, \u201cAh.\u201d And I\u2019d look at him and be like, \u201cOh, man. Dad hates yogurt.\u201d [laughter] \u201cHe hates milk.\u201d But I get that look, now. Life is tough and sometimes you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. He has a little kid and I\u2019m not making his life any easier. I\u2019m picking up soda and I\u2019m like, \u201cAh!\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t do that.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to live forever!\u201d Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes and I would drop the soda and it would explode. And then my dad would do what most brown parents do. He would check to see if the coast is clear\u2026 and he\u2019d slap the shit out of me. [laughter] I love it. Thank you. Thank you. Pockets were acknowledging that. And for the liberal white guilt, immigrants aren\u2019t going to hit their children the way you do. Americans hit on the arm and bruise the body. Immigrants slap your face and bruise your soul. It\u2019s Guantanamo of the mind. And I know some of you guys are like, \u201cHey, this is Davis, okay? I listen to NPR. Ira Glass says children are our future.\u201d Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me? Do you know when brown kids get slapped? Every brown birthday party. And usually it\u2019s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, \u201cAh, Biju got slapped on his birthday!\u201d And that\u2019s what makes us tough and resilient. It\u2019s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.\nYou ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. [laughter] That kid won\u2019t choke on camera. He\u2019s been slapped on camera. \u2013 Of course he can spell \u201cknaidel\u201d. \u2013 Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! He\u2019s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing. People ask, \u201cWhere does that come from?\u201d Look at this kid\u2019s parents. Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Look at his brother. His brother is like, \u201cI\u2019m fucked. I\u2019m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.\u201d People say, \u201cWhere\u2019s Bobby Jindal from?\u201d That\u2019s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath. [raucous laughter] I know what happens when I talk about this. People say, \u201cYour parents don\u2019t love you.\u201d I think our parents love us. We have great fathers. I just think our fathers didn\u2019t download all the great dad software. There are just a few apps missing. Birthdays aren\u2019t their thing. Every immigrant father feels like if they brought you to the US\u2026 Happy Birthday. Starbucks, Wi-Fi, freeways, happy birthday. No more birthdays. Go be president. At an interview, this lady said, \u201cDescribe your earliest birthday memory.\u201d I was like, \u201cDo I have to?\u201d So I\u2019m six, I\u2019m turning seven. My dad wakes me up super early in the morning. \u201cHasan, get up! Get in the Camry.\u201d The immigrant car of choice. We get in the Camry, we\u2019re driving from Davis to Sacramento. There\u2019s one mall in the entire area. Arden. We get to this intersection, and I look to my left, and it\u2019s the one place every kid dreams about. Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us. I was like, \u201cOh, shit! Dad saw the Toys \u2018R\u2019 Us catalog on my wall. He saw my vision board. He saw the blue BMX bike I wanted. He\u2019s here to surprise me. Turn left. Turn left. Turn\u2026 left.\u201d Then he turns right, and I\u2019m like, \u201cHome Depot? No!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy are we here? Do you know what day it is?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Saturday.\u201d \u201cNo, it\u2019s my birthday. Did you forget?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cHasan, how could I forget that it\u2019s your birthday? That\u2019s why I brought you here. So you could pick the door handle for the bathroom.\u201d [laughter] And I was like, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have me pick out the toilet? You are shitting on my dreams.\u201d I didn\u2019t say that. I would have gotten a slap. I wanted to say that. That\u2019s when I realized there\u2019s a generational gap between us and our parents. You\u2019re going to fight with your parents, and there\u2019s a finite number of hands you can play. You know about this. Not going to be a doctor? That\u2019s a hand. Marry a white girl? Boom! That\u2019s a big hand. [laughter, applause] I could have been like, \u201cDad, fight me. I want that bike.\u201d But I was like, \u201cHang on to your cards. You\u2019ll need them later.\u201d Like, I had vision as a six-year-old. And my mom, she would come and visit, and just kill the mom game. One year, she came to school and brought me a Ghostbusters proton pack. The wheelie thing, the backpack, the gun that catches ghosts\u2026 Literally shut Pioneer down. Kids were losing their minds. \u201cWhat? Saddam Hussein\u2019s a Ghostbuster?\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m a brown Ghostbuster. Deal with it.\u201d One of the happiest days of my life. But then she would go back to India. That\u2019s when I realized I don\u2019t want a toy. I just want my mom. I want to be a family. I was very emo. I was like Drake. I missed that girl. \u201cWhen is she coming back? I need her in my life. I need her. I need that girl. I need that girl in my life. I need her, Dad. She used to call me on my phone.\u201d My dad\u2019s like, \u201cWhen the visa comes through.\u201d \u201cWhen the visa comes through.\u201d It\u2019s a big deal. I don\u2019t care what anyone says. It\u2019s difficult to get in this country. It\u2019s not like a broken condom where you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019m in!\u201d [laughter] Eight years. August 11th, 1993. I\u2019m so excited. I put on my Ghostbusters proton pack. I\u2019m standing there. Dad goes, \u201cPut on Indian clothes.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright. I can be an Indian ghostbuster.\u201d I put on a Salwar Kameez. I\u2019m standing there. Door opens. Dad walks through. Mom walks through. And then immediately behind my mom, is this little brown girl with a mushroom cut. She runs up to me and hugs me. \u201cHasan bhai!\u201d And I\u2019m in full hover-hands mode, because I have no idea who this person is. What happened was, my dad would go back and forth to India to visit my mom, and during one trip he knocked her up. [shocked laughter] And I had a sister. But no one told me about it. [uproarious laughter] Remember how I told you that immigrants love secrets? This is a secret that nobody told me! He says, \u201cHug her.\u201d \u201cYou brought her out like Maury for immigrants.\u201d \u201cHasan, you are the brother.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, no!\u201d She was breakdancing, and I\u2019m like, \u201cWho the fuck are you?\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t know me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve no idea who you are.\u201d I hated that brown girl so much. I was like, \u201cBuild that wall.\u201d I was like a little Republican. I was like, \u201cI get it.\u201d I remember leveling with my parents at the dinner table. \u201cLook, Mom, Dad, let\u2019s just be real. Oh, my God, these brown people\u2026 Oh, jeez. Coming into our house\u2026 eating our Fruit Roll-Ups\u2026 they don\u2019t speak the language\u2026 I say we tell them to go back where they came from.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou can\u2019t say that. We\u2019re family.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cNo, that\u2019s on you and Mom. You guys decided to get your Angelina Jolie on, and bring over this FOB. That\u2019s on you, that\u2019s not on me.\u201d Why do you do this to your daughters? Every single brown mother makes your daughter quincea\u00f1era dress, chop cuts. Why? Princess from here down, Toad from here up. I\u2019ve got this shit following me around on the playground. \u201cHasan bhai!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, kick rocks!\u201d I go play tetherball. \u201cHasan bhai!\u201d \u201cGet lost!\u201d Eventually, I run to the boys\u2019 bathroom. She follows me into the bathroom. \u201cHasan bhai!\u201d All the kids at the urinal are like, \u201cUh! What\u2019s Hasan-bye?\u201d I went to school with a bunch of Ryan Lochtes. Just all traps. [slow, stupid voice] \u201cUh, I don\u2019t understand other cultures, bro. What is that? What does it mean?\u201d It\u2019s a term of endearment in my culture, meaning \u201cbrother\u201d. \u201cShut up, Cody!\u201d I took that anger and channeled it at her. I was like, \u201cHey! You\u2019re not my sister.\u201d [gasps in audience] But she couldn\u2019t understand English. [laughter, applause] But she got what I was saying. She starts crying and runs out. I was like, \u201cNo! She\u2019s going to tell Dad.\u201d Let\u2019s focus on what\u2019s important here. But she didn\u2019t. And my dad\u2026 It was her first birthday in the US. She was turning five. So for her first birthday, he wanted it to be special. I can imagine being a father, missing your daughter\u2019s first steps, her first time saying \u201cDada\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a hard thing. So for her birthday, he brings everyone into the living room. He drags in this big box and goes, \u201cAisha, open the box.\u201d She cuts open the box and unfurls one of the flaps, and I see \u201cToys \u2018R\u2019 Us\u201d emblazoned on one of the flaps. And he reaches in, and pulls out a beautiful, blue BMX bike. [audience gasps] \u201cHere you go, Aisha.\u201d He looks at me. \u201cHappy Birthday.\u201d [shocked laughter, booing] Savage, right? I\u2019m livid. I\u2019m like, \u201cYo, when did Home Depot Dad become Danny Tanner? This is bullshit. Really?\u201d I\u2019m livid. And Aisha senses it. She\u2019s like, \u201cHasan bhai, why don\u2019t you take it out?\u201d And as an elder brother, I felt entitled to that bike. \u201cThat\u2019s my bike. Thank you.\u201d Younger siblings, you guys are worthless. You bring nothing to the table. I see you getting mad. \u201cHell, no. I have a personality.\u201d Where do you think you got that from, dummy? Us. Clothes, culture, money. \u201cWhoa! I have opinions.\u201d No, you don\u2019t. And then you have the audacity to be, like, \u201cHey, why are you so melodramatic?\u201d Because I went to war for you. Mom and Dad was my Vietnam. And you\u2019re like, \u201cEverybody loves me.\u201d It\u2019s such bullshit, right? Elder siblings, we walk through the world like, \u201cDo people love me?\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cMom and Dad fucked up with you, not with me.\u201d [shocked laughter] She\u2019s like, \u201cTake it for one lap around the block.\u201d [speaking Hindi] I grab those handlebars, I\u2019m like, \u201cFuck that noise.\u201d Boom. I take off. She\u2019s like, \u201cHasan bhai, come back!\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cEat my dust, immigrant.\u201d I\u2019m flying. I see a curb. I\u2019m about to pop a wheelie. The bike goes left, I go right. And that beautiful blue BMX bike\u2026 Bam! It crashes into the cement. All the paint is chipped off the right side of the bike. I pick it up, and it\u2019s destroyed. I hear the patter of her chappals. She\u2019s crying, \u201cHasan bhai, why would you do this?\u201d Anim\u00e9 tears of innocence. \u201cWhy? I gave you the first ride.\u201d And I\u2019m looking down at her, and I\u2019m like, \u201cMan\u2026 I\u2019m being a dick.\u201d Like, this whole time I was looking for acceptance from Cody, Corey and Cole\u2026 [laughter] and I had it right here this entire time. I\u2019m supposed to be her big brother, help her navigate the American dream and protect her. And I\u2019m out here stealing her bike? This is fucked up. And Aisha hates that story. She\u2019s always like, \u201cOh, my God, you are so melodramatic. You make me sound like a refugee baby.\u201d That\u2019s true. I\u2019m doing that right now. It\u2019s not fair, because she\u2019s not a refugee. And, like, she learned English. She went to an Ivy League law school. She does mergers and acquisitions now. She is the one percent. Meanwhile, I\u2026 I didn\u2019t go to grad school. I became a comedian. This is what I do. And then, when it came time for me to get married, I got married to a girl from a Hindu family. I heard an audible \u201cOh!\u201d Alright. Fuck. I heard you go, like, \u201cUgh!\u201d I didn\u2019t punch you. Damn!\nSo some of you guys don\u2019t know. Hindus and Muslims are like the Montagues and Capulets of India. We\u2019ve been warring for centuries. You\u2019re like, \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference? You look the same.\u201d So how do I explain this? Hindus and Muslims. So Hindus\u2026 Hindus don\u2019t eat beef. \u201cNo beef!\u201d Right? And Muslims, we don\u2019t eat pork. \u201cIs that pepperoni pizza? No. No pepperoni!\u201d And then Hindus, they like statues. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh! This is a statue of an elephant. I\u2019m going to put this in my car.\u201d [laughter, applause] Muslims are like, \u201cNo statues! Calligraphy! We\u2019re about the alphabet. We put that in our car. We\u2019re different.\u201d And then Hindus, they like cartoons. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, this is a cartoon Ganesh. I\u2019ll just put this on the wall.\u201d And Muslims\u2026 we don\u2019t really, uh, like cartoons. We\u2019ve got to get better about our cartoon policy. Because of this we\u2019ve been killing each other for centuries. And I know the older generation doesn\u2019t like those jokes. \u201cPakistan was created because of this reason.\u201d I know, but\u2026 I convinced my dad. \u201cDad, I love her, she loves me. Isn\u2019t there something bigger that unites all of us outside of race, color, creed, class? This is America. We can choose what we want to adhere from the motherland. Isn\u2019t life like biryani, where you push the weird shit to the side? Why do we got to adhere to this weird shit from back over there? He agrees. He\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s a good point. Fine. You should get married.\u201d That\u2019s a Hall of Fame brown dad decision. There\u2019s brown dads here, like, \u201cIf my son did that, I would shoot myself and then shoot him.\u201d He says yes. We rally the troops, Me, Mom, Dad, Aisha, we get in the Camry, we\u2019re driving to my fianc\u00e9e\u2019s house. And we\u2019re about to pull up and we get to the door, and my dad is about to ring the doorbell, when he says the sentence that is the killer of every brown kid\u2019s dream. He goes, \u201cI don\u2019t think we should do this. Log kya kahenge? [audience gasps] \u201cWhat will people think?\u201d I don\u2019t know if you know, but every time a brown father says log kya kahenge, a star actually falls from the sky. [laughter] \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a doctor!\u201d \u201cLog kya kahenge!\u201d No! \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry!\u201d \u201cLog kya kahenge!\u201d Why? I bet you, when Mahatma Gandhi told his parents he was going to liberate India, even they were like, \u201cLog kya kahenge! \u201cStop marching. The British are going to talk shit about us. Why are you bald and skinny? You\u2019re never going to get married.\u201d And I\u2019m standing there\u2026 on that doorstep. [applause, cheering] Wait, I\u2019m standing there\u2026 on that doorstep, like, \u201cWait, you want me to change my life because of log kya kahenge? Come on, Dad. How many times do we complain about racism in our community? All the time. Now the ball is in our court, we\u2019re going to be bigoted? Dad, I promise you, God doesn\u2019t like bigotry. God\u2019s not like, \u2018You\u2019re racist. Good job.\u2019 No! Number two, you want me to change my life to appease some aunty and uncle I\u2019m never going to see? You want me to change my life for Naila Aunty? Fuck Naila Aunty. Are you fucking kidding me? My life?\u201d But I can\u2019t say that. Because I\u2019ve played all my cards. So I can\u2019t say anything. Now I\u2019m losing hope. I\u2019m, like, \u201cMaybe this is bigger than me. Why can\u2019t I put my head down and do what I\u2019m supposed to do? This ain\u2019t Jodhaa Akbar.\u201d Have you ever been trapped by the time you live in? It\u2019s been going on for centuries. So I\u2019m walking back to the Camry, then I hear a voice behind me. \u201cOh, my God. You guys do this all the time.\u201d And it is Aisha, and she is pissed. And she\u2019s like, \u201cDad, I did not fly out from Philly for this.\u201d [laughter] \u201cBeena is so legit. She has a PhD. Hasan bhai is a comedian.\u201d [laughter, applause, whooping] \u201cNo one is going to marry him. Get him married before she changes her mind.\u201d She stepped up. She laid down one of her cards for me. She Phil Jacksoned that situation. She got all these people working together. Because of her, I got to marry the love of my life. Because of my sister. I can\u2019t believe it. [rapturous applause] For years I resented that brown girl. I hated her. But on that day, on that special day, I couldn\u2019t have been more proud to be her Hasan bhai. [applause, whistling] [whooping] [huge applause] [applause fades] You know, they say every generation is defined by a great struggle or tragedy. And it\u2019s wild that our kids will never know there was a period in time in this country where you had to make a choice between being on the internet or being on the phone. [laughter] They won\u2019t get it, dude. You\u2019ll never get it. You don\u2019t get it, man. You won\u2019t. That was our World War I, man. Especially in middle school, if a girl called the house, you had to pick up the phone before your parents. We used to have landlines. It\u2019s like phones connected to the land. And one time in middle school a girl called the house. My dad picked it up before me. \u201cHello, who is this?\u201d \u201cHi, it\u2019s Alice. Is Hasan there?\u201d \u201cWhat you want, Alice?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m going to die a virgin.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m in Geometry with Hasan. I had a question. Can I ask him the question?\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cOkay, Alice. Why don\u2019t you ask me the question, then I\u2019ll ask Hasan?\u201d That\u2019s the way our parents are. Ages zero through 30, \u201cNo girls!\u201d At 35, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you talk to girls?\u201d That\u2019s basically it. \u201cAh, you kill me!\u201d [applause, whooping] That\u2019s the way our parents are, right? Our parents are like a firewall to the outside world. They disseminate information to us. It\u2019s like living in North Korea. My dad is the leader of the household. So when 9-11 happened I was in high school. My dad sits everybody down. He\u2019s like, \u201cHasan, whatever you do, do not tell people you\u2019re Muslim or talk about politics.\u201d \u201cAlright, Dad, I\u2019ll just hide it. This just rubs off.\u201d We\u2019re sitting there. Phone rings. I run, but my dad beats me to the phone. \u201cHello?\u201d I grab the second phone. I hear a voice. \u201cHey, you sand nigger, where\u2019s Osama?\u201d [audience gasps] He looks at me. \u201cYou can hear me, right? You fucking dune coon. Where\u2019s Osama?\u201d \u201cHey, 2631 Regatta Lane, that\u2019s where you live, right? I\u2019m going to fucking kill you.\u201d Click. And my dad\u2019s looking at me. Do you ever see your parents, and you see the mortality in them? I\u2019m looking at my dad and I see all five-seven of him. And that\u2019s when I realize I\u2019m a darapok. I\u2019m a scaredy-cat. We can speak two languages. We can speak at home and outside. I should have said something. I didn\u2019t. We sit down. I hear \u201cthud, thud, thud\u201d outside. Me and Dad run outside and all the windows on the Camry are smashed in. My backpack\u2019s open. \u201cFuck, they stole my stuff.\u201d I reach and I pull out my backpack. Pieces of glass get caught in my arm. Now blood is gushing down my arm, and I\u2019m pissed, I\u2019m fucking mad. Fuck this, man! These kids know where we live, they\u2019re timing this, so they\u2019re watching us. So I\u2019m looking in the trees, the bushes\u2026 I look back in the middle of the street, my dad is in the middle of the road sweeping glass out of the road like he works at a barbershop. \u201cWe\u2019ve got customers. Log kya kahenge? We\u2019ve got to clean this up.\u201d Zen! Brown Mr Miyagi, just, like, not saying a word. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy aren\u2019t you saying something? I\u2019m asking you, say something!\u201d He looks at me and goes, \u201cHasan\u2026\u201d [speaking Hindi] [speaking Hindi] \u201cThese things happen, and these things will continue to happen. That\u2019s the price we pay for being here.\u201d That\u2019s when I was like, \u201cWe really are from two different generations.\u201d BMX bikes aside. My dad\u2019s from that generation where he feels like if you come to this country, you pay the American dream tax. You endure racism, and if it doesn\u2019t cost you your life, pay it. There you go, Uncle Sam. But for me, I was born here. So I actually have the audacity of equality. I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m in Honors Gov, I have it right here. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. All men created equal.\u201d It says it right here, I\u2019m equal. I\u2019m equal. I don\u2019t deserve this. [deafening applause] But as soon as I say that\u2026 He looks at me like I believe in Santa. \u201cHasan, you\u2019ll never understand.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll never understand? Dad, you\u2019re the guy that will argue with the cashier at Costco when he doesn\u2019t let you return used underwear. And now you want to be the bigger man? Now you\u2019re like, \u2018Let\u2019s be reasonable with the bigots.\u2019 What?\u201d And then he just walks back into the house with glass in his feet. And I honestly don\u2019t know who is more right. Maybe he\u2019s right. Put your head down. Be a doctor, get a house in the burbs, let them call them whatever you want. But isn\u2019t it our job to push the needle forward little by little? Isn\u2019t that how all this stuff happens? I don\u2019t know. The pendulum swings back and forth for me. And I know 9\/11 is a super touchy subject. I understand. Because when it happened, everyone in America felt like their country was under attack. But on that night, September 12th, it was the first night of so many nights where my family\u2019s loyalty to this country was under attack. And it always sucks. As immigrants we always have to put on these press releases to prove our patriotism. We\u2019re auditioning. \u201cWe love this country, please believe me.\u201d Nobody loves this country more than us. I fell in love here. Six years old, Janice Malo. I saw her in the sandbox. I run up to her. First grade. \u201cI love you!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re the color of poop.\u201d That\u2019s memory number one. The first time you experience racism? I was like, \u201cWhat? Oh, no! It\u2019s not rubbing off!\u201d I was fucking terrified. It was like Inception. There were so many levels. I just wanted to wake up and be like, \u201cOh, it was all a dream. I\u2019m JGL. It was all a dream.\u201d But it\u2019s not a dream, it\u2019s the universe telling you, \u201cIt\u2019s a Fair and Lovely world. Navigate accordingly.\u201d In the third grade, Miss Anderson said, \u201cWrite what you want to be.\u201d Some kids were like, \u201can astronaut,\u201d or \u201ca firefighter.\u201d I was like, \u201cI want to be white.\u201d [shocked laughter] \u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d \u201cI want this part of my skin to be all of my skin.\u201d And it wasn\u2019t like, \u201cI hate melanin.\u201d I love melanin. I\u2019ve never gotten a sunburn. I\u2019m blessed. [laughter, applause, whooping] But when you\u2019re white and you\u2019re playing the video game of life, and your avatar is white, you just get asked less questions along the way. You pop out. Boom. \u201cI want to be Batman.\u201d \u201cWell, of course. Batman is white. Duh!\u201d \u201cI want to be president.\u201d \u201cDuh! Forty-four-and-a-half presidents are white. We\u2019ve had a great track record.\u201d And I know the privilege debate is very heavy for white people. I know you guys have problems. I\u2019ve seen Girls. [laughter] My dad did not give a shit about any of this identity stuff. His rules with me were very simple. \u201cNo fun, no girlfriends. Have fun in med school.\u201d Which is a huge lie. It never gets popping in med school. I\u2019ve never been to a club and seen nine dudes: \u201cYo, what\u2019s going on?\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Residency, fam!\u201d Never happens. \u201cI got a career I hate from my parents.\u201d It\u2019s a lie. We buy into it. So by my senior year of high school, I had yet to go to a school dance, I had been cut from the basketball team, and I had just got off this medicine called Accutane so my skin and face was peeling. I\u2019m crushing life. Out here, killing it. No one did that. Don\u2019t clap. No one did that for that photo. No one ever did that at my school. It\u2019s too late. But there was one bright spot, this girl named Bethany Reed. And her family had just moved from Nebraska to Davis, and we were in AP Calc together, but\u2026 we had chemistry. She sat behind me, first day, she\u2019s like, \u201cHey\u2026 what\u2019s your AIM screen name?\u201d [laughter] I was like, \u201cIt\u2019s about to go down. Do you want it? I could give it to you.\u201d Whatever I lacked in real-life game, my digital game\u2026 bananas. Status updates, away messages, sub profile, Boyz II Men. Don\u2019t say you don\u2019t like \u201cWater Runs Dry\u201d. I was a lover. Late at night on AIM, back and forth, back and forth\u2026 You guys don\u2019t know this. Some of you guys are just in college, Snapchatting. Back in the day, we had to fire up the internet like goddamn cavemen. You know what I mean? [makes long, crackling, buzzing noise] [blows] If someone picked up the phone, \u201cHey, get off the phone! I\u2019m trying to talk to somebody!\u201d That\u2019s how we would communicate. Late at night, back and forth, back and forth. One night she was like, \u201cHey, come over.\u201d I bike over to her place, white picket fence, McMansion, Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer edition. [audience cheers] \u201cOh, they made it!\u201d Mrs Reed opens the door. Her father is this successful retired judge. Mrs Reed\u2019s like, \u201cYou want brownies?\u201d \u201cYeah. Cool.\u201d \u201cHey, stay for dinner.\u201d \u201cWe just had brownies, but okay.\u201d We\u2019re sitting there at the dinner table. And now Mrs Reed\u2019s like, \u201cHey, honey, we know so much about Bethany, but we don\u2019t know anything about you. What do you like? What are you into?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat?\u201d [laughter] \u201cWhat do I like? Um\u2026 Nobody\u2026 Nobody has ever asked me that before.\u201d [laughter] \u201cI guess I like acoustic guitar.\u201d \u201cYou should do that. You should follow your dreams.\u201d [laughter] \u201cMaybe I will. Maybe I will follow my dreams.\u201d Then Bethany\u2019s like, \u201cHey, we always study at my house. Why don\u2019t we study at your house?\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019ve got to go.\u201d What, invite you over to my house? You walk in: \u201cWhat language are you guys speaking? What\u2019s that smell?\u201d I\u2019m not going to open myself up to that. But I was like, \u201cNo, she\u2019s different.\u201d I hit her up late at night. \u201cMom, Dad, a school friend is coming over. Everyone here, please be normal.\u201d My dad is like, \u201cWe are normal.\u201d Killing me, you know what I mean? \u201cHasan, we\u2019re normal. Be proud. You should be proud.\u201d Who is proud? No one is. You\u2019re walking around like a rooster. I\u2019m not proud and no one is proud. We get there. We\u2019re sitting on my living room table. My mom and dad are arguing in Hindi. My mom is frying pakoras. The fobbiest thing ever. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is playing on Zee TV. But it\u2019s too much. It\u2019s all coming at this girl. It\u2019s too much. You\u2019ve got to ease your way in. She\u2019s from Nebraska. Soul cycle, yoga, then Zee TV. Don\u2019t just, like, go into it. So I\u2019m looking at her, like, \u201cDon\u2019t say anything. Please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d She looks up from her book, and she\u2019s like, \u201cYou know what? This is really nice. We should do this more often. This is really nice.\u201d And I look at her, and I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, my God. I love you, my white princess.\u201d [laughter] \u201cYou see me. I don\u2019t got to change who I am? I can be me!\u201d So I\u2019m going back and forth. Her house, my house. One night, we\u2019re on the living room table. We\u2019re doing integrals. [laughter] She closes her book. She\u2019s like, \u201cHey. It\u2019s late.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cIt is late.\u201d And she\u2019s like\u2026 \u201cI should go home.\u201d I was like, \u201cYeah, you should\u2026\u201d Why did you say that? That was your chance. Don\u2019t do that. I said, \u201cWait, let me walk you out.\u201d So I\u2019m walking her out. She gets in the car. I\u2019m about to close the door. She rams her arm into the door, leans out and gives me a kiss. \u201cI love you.\u201d Drives off into the night. Like a fucking G! Because she knew the rules. She knew the rules. No fun, no friends, no girlfriends. All we had was that stolen moment in my driveway. You guys are like, \u201cI was getting handjobs when I was nine.\u201d Not me. Not this guy. Not you, not you, not you. Not us. I was like, \u201cAre we getting married? I have to change my pants. We are definitely getting married. When is the shaadi?\u201d [applause] Now, my AP Calc class was a group of overachievers and my Calc teacher, Mr Pendleton, wanted us to live lives outside of school. So one day he gets up in front of the entire class. \u201cAlright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley.\u201d One kid was like, \u201cI know, getting into Stanford.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cNo, you have to live a life worth talking about, which is why I\u2019m making it mandatory for everyone in this class to go to prom.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cAll 30 of us? We\u2019re all going to prom? AP Calc? Us? Me, Jehovah\u2019s Witness girl, Korean exchange students, going to the prom? Thirty for 30? All of us?\u201d I\u2019m laughing so hard, I\u2019m crying. He\u2019s like, \u201cHanson, this is not funny.\u201d He walks over to the board, he pulls it down. It\u2019s a bracket with everybody\u2019s name on it leading up to the big dance. It\u2019s March Madness for nerds. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhatever, it\u2019s not going to happen. He can\u2019t do this.\u201d Weeks go by. Kids start getting dates. Three days before prom he walks to the board. Last two names: Hasan Minhaj, Bethany Reed. The class goes nuts. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh! They\u2019re going to fuck!\u201d \u201cNo, we\u2019re not! Are we? No, no we\u2019re not.\u201d I look at her, \u201cPlease don\u2019t say anything.\u201d She says nothing, like a G. [laughter] Bell rings. I\u2019m walking to my locker. I hear footsteps. She\u2019s like, \u201cWait up.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d \u201cOh, that was crazy back there. What are the chances?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cListen, you know, ever since my family moved from Nebraska, you\u2019ve been my best friend. And you\u2019re really special to me. This year wouldn\u2019t be the same without you. So I was wondering, will you go to prom with me?\u201d [applause, whooping] I was like, \u201cYes, my white princess.\u201d As soon as I said that, I was like, \u201cNo!\u201d I had bitten off more than I could chew. \u201cNo, wait. You\u2019ve got cards to play. You\u2019re good. You\u2019re a good kid. Also, remember, parents respect honesty. You\u2019ve seen this on TV. If you go home and are honest, your parents will be like, \u2018Even though I disagree with you, I respect your candor. Therefore I will grant your wish.'\u201d I ran home, I was like, \u201cDad, I would like to go to prom.\u201d [speaking Hindi] Which means, \u201cI will break your face.\u201d \u201cDuly noted, father.\u201d \u201cBethany, situation at home. Father doesn\u2019t want us to go to prom. I\u2019m going to sneak out. I live on the second story. I\u2019m going to jump off and land on my bike. I\u2019ll bike to your place, we dance it up, and if I die, I had a great run.\u201d You know? You\u2019re going to die, so put it on the tombstone. \u201cHasan Minhaj, 4.3 GPA, kissed a white girl.\u201d What an amazing way to go. The night of prom rolls around. I put on the JC Penney suit. Spray on the Michael Jordan cologne. Six puffs, one for each championship. You don\u2019t want to overkill it with the MJ cologne. Don\u2019t be tacky. I\u2019m scaling down the side of my roof, scraping my knees. I jump off the roof. It\u2019s like 20 feet. I jump off, I somehow land, I get on my bike. It\u2019s beautiful, the sun is setting, it\u2019s one of those gorgeous evenings. And I\u2019m biking with my knees bowed out. So my slacks don\u2019t get caught up in the chains. Fast enough to get there, but slow enough to not get pit stains. I\u2019m balancing the corsage. [panting] \u201cAlright, go. Go. You\u2019re good. You\u2019re getting there.\u201d [wild applause and cheering] I get to her house. I park my bike. I\u2019m walking up to the doorstep, and I\u2019m about to ring the doorbell when I\u2019m like, \u201cWait. 30 second time-out. Do you understand what\u2019s about to go down? You\u2019re about to go to prom with Bethany motherfucking Reed.\u201d [applause] \u201cThis is the American dream. This is what Dad fought for.\u201d Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door. She has this look of concern. And I look over her shoulder, and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage on Bethany\u2019s wrist. [audience sighs] And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh, my God, honey, did Bethany not tell you? Sweetie, we love you, we think you\u2019re great. We love that you come over and study. But tonight is one of those nights\u2026 We have a lot of family back home in Nebraska and we\u2019re going to be taking photos, so we don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a good fit. Do you need a ride home? Mr Reed can give you a ride home.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, I have my bike.\u201d And I just biked home and played Mario Kart. That\u2019s the nicest I\u2019ve ever been dressed, playing Mario Kart. [laughter] I wish I had said, \u201cFuck that, I\u2019m going to the dance.\u201d I didn\u2019t. The sad part is, I felt bad for being there. Who was I to ruin their picture-perfect celebration? You\u2019ve seen movies. How many times do you see that on screen? And it\u2019s not like they were yokels yelling \u201csand nigger!\u201d I could let that pass. I\u2019d eaten off their plates, kissed their daughter. I didn\u2019t know that people could be bigoted even as they were smiling at you. It\u2019s hard when you see people saying they love you but they\u2019re afraid at the same time. And I didn\u2019t know what that meant. [applause] Then the following Monday, during first period she finds me. She\u2019s like, \u201cEverybody has been asking why we didn\u2019t go. Please don\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s a generational thing. Please don\u2019t say anything.\u201d And I look at her. Second period rolls around like clockwork. Mr Pendleton\u2019s like, \u201cSo, lovebirds, what happened? Everybody\u2019s wondering.\u201d So I\u2019m, like, \u201cYeah, what happened?\u201d Looking at her. She just looks down. Now everybody\u2019s looking at me so I\u2019ve got to improvise. I was like, \u201cYeah, you know, I decided not to go. I mean, dances are overrated. They\u2019re a clich\u00e9. I decided not to go.\u201d Everybody in the class looked at me. \u201cWow, you dick.\u201d \u201cYou stood up the new girl? Thank God Jeff took her. You\u2019re a dick.\u201d That\u2019s the last time we ever spoke. And you know, time has passed, and I don\u2019t really think about that day. I mean, I did write a show about it, but\u2026 [laughter] like a lot of people\u2026 [cheering] [more cheering, whooping] you move on to different chapters of your life. You have selective memory. You\u2019re in college. Tools, Clear History. Out of college. Tools, Clear History. Never did that. Married. Tools, Clear History. Never happened. Second marriage, Tools, Clear History. Never happened. But for the most part, I actually think about it the way my dad does. \u201cOh, you couldn\u2019t go to prom with a white girl? Who gives a fuck? At least your spine isn\u2019t getting shattered in a police wagon, though it\u2019s happening to African-Americans to this day. So this is a tax you have to pay? I\u2019ll pay it. \u2018I can\u2019t date your daughter.\u2019 I don\u2019t give a fuck, Uncle Sam. Take it.\u201d But then I realized, wait, hold on. Why is it every time the collateral damage has to be death, for us to talk about this? A kid has to get shot 16 times for us to be like, \u201cMaybe we have a race problem.\u201d For every Trayvon Martin or Ahmed the clock kid, there is bigotry that happens every day. Because we\u2019re too afraid of the Other. Someone who\u2019s not in our tribe. I wish I could tell 18-year-old me, \u201cHey, man, don\u2019t let this experience define you. It\u2019s good people and bad people. Irrespective of creed, class, color, find those people. Because love is bigger than fear.\u201d I wish I could tell him that. I really believe that. [applause, cheering] I really believe love is bigger than fear. Fox News has taught me that. Fox News is incredible. I\u2019ve never seen so many people with spray tans hate people of color. It is amazing. And Fox News is in New York. They\u2019re in New York. Daily Show, Fox News, five avenues away from each other. That\u2019s it. Professor X, Magneto, that close. Every day I walk past their building during lunch. I\u2019ll see all the employees, Hannity, Coulter, O\u2019Reilly, leave their building, cross the street, walk past me, and line up for halal chicken and rice. I\u2019m like, \u201cUh\u2026 Racist Randy wants that red sauce.\u201d Your brain can be racist, but your body will just betray you. I love that so much. All morning, they\u2019re like, \u201cMexicans, all lives matter, Arabs\u2026 12:01! Shwarma time!\u201d I love that so much. And I wish I could tell 18-year-old me that, but I can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have a time machine. I can\u2019t tell him that. You know what the shitty part is? When you first fall in love, you get that first taste of the Heisenberg blue. It\u2019s never the same after that. People here with girlfriends are like, \u201cBabe, it\u2019s different with you.\u201d You\u2019re lying and that\u2019s okay. But we had those first secrets. My secret was, \u201cI want to be a comedian.\u201d She said, \u201cI want to be a journalist.\u201d We promised we would follow our dreams, no matter what people would think. So I started doing comedy. I wasn\u2019t very good. Two years, three years, four years, six years, seven years\u2026 I finally get a chance to headline a comedy club. It\u2019s a big deal for me. Gotham Comedy Club, New York City. I did what a lot of early comedians do. I got on Facebook, I got super cocky. I was like, \u201cYo, Facebook! Your boy, headlining Gotham Comedy Club. Let me know if you want some tix.\u201d All caps. Like, relax! I sent it. I was like, \u201cI\u2019m a headliner. Let\u2019s go to the airport. LA, Chicago, Nashville, New York\u2026 I\u2019m flying Southwest. I was like, \u201cI made it! Oh, hello. La Quinta Inn! Don\u2019t mind if I do. Free Wi-Fi? Why not? Let\u2019s see what the internet is saying about me. I open up my laptop, fire up Facebook, and I see this. \u201cHey, um, long time no see. You\u2019re doing comedy now. So cool. Listen, me and my girlfriends live in Manhattan and we were wondering if we could get some tix?\u201d Question mark. Okay. [laughter] [sighs with pleasure as he drinks] [applause] I don\u2019t know if you know what this means. But, you know, if life gives you lemons, sometimes you\u2019ve got to make \u201crevenge lemonade.\u201d Sprinkle in a little irony. Reply, son. Reply. \u201cBethany, comma, enter. Totally remember you. Long time no see, indeed.\u201d [talks gibberish in high-pitched voice] \u201cSeven years. A lot of time. Listen, I would love to give you some tix, but we\u2019re going to be taking a lot of photos tonight\u2026 [audience gasps, applauds] and I don\u2019t think you\u2019d be a good fit.\u201d Send that shit! Send that shit right now! Send that shit right now! I jump on stage! I run to the club, jump on stage\u2026 I don\u2019t even know what I said. I was like, \u201cFuck that. Goodnight.\u201d Boom. I go to the airport. We go from New York, Chicago, to Nashville to LA. I pick up my Toyota Camry L-motherfucking-E. Don\u2019t you ever forget about it. Cloth interior for life. Whipping through the streets of LA. \u201cHello, headliner. What do you need?\u201d \u201cHasan bhai, Dad had a heart attack. Hey\u2026 idiot, pick up your phone. I need you. Dad had a heart attack.\u201d My dad had just suffered a quintuple bypass. So they\u2019re rushing him to the hospital. Aisha goes, \u201cCome home, now.\u201d I was like, \u201cI got a set at the Comedy Store. I\u2019m going to do that, then I\u2019ll come home.\u201d And I did a set at the Comedy Store. And then I drove home. And I don\u2019t know why\u2026 I get to Kaiser and run upstairs. My mom and my sisters are crying. My sister looks at me, she\u2019s like, \u201cThey don\u2019t know what you did. I do.\u201d Doctor sees me. \u201cAre you his son?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re over 18? Sign this.\u201d I sign this waiver that clears the hospital of liability if something happens to my dad. The surgery is that risky. I\u2019m signing this piece of paper and looking at him, and I feel like I\u2019m signing a death certificate. His body temperature is so low that he looks blue. They wheel him into surgery and I hand the clipboard to the doctor. I look at my dad, like, \u201cIf this is the last time I see my dad\u2026 I\u2019m saying goodbye to a person I barely even know.\u201d And I\u2019m waiting, hoping that he comes out of surgery okay. And somehow he makes it through. We\u2019re in the hospital. I have to tell him stories. So I\u2019m telling him stories about my life, he\u2019s telling me stories about his. So I tell him the prom story. He goes, \u201cHasan, I\u2019m mad at you.\u201d \u201cI know, I kissed a girl. I\u2019ll never do it again.\u201d [laughter] He goes, \u201cNo\u2026 why don\u2019t you forgive Bethany?\u201d [speaking Hindi] He wanted to be the bigger person again. I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cYou know when I emigrated to this country in 1982, I thought if I let you go to a school dance, you would join a gang, get a girl pregnant and become a drug dealer, in one night. I wanted to protect you. Her family saw stuff about us. They wanted to protect their daughter. Everybody\u2019s afraid of everybody. But Hasan\u2026\u201d [speaking Hindi] [speaking Hindi, voice becomes more insistent] \u201cHasan, you have to be brave. Your courage to do what\u2019s right has to be greater than your fear of getting hurt. So, Hasan, be brave. Hasan, be brave.\u201d It\u2019s a very beautiful poem. I think about it all the time. And look, there are some days where I can forgive that person. The past is the past. Tools, Clear History. It\u2019s done. Other days, \u201cNo, fuck that. This is House of Cards. Crush our enemies.\u201d I didn\u2019t know how to feel, until this. Pizza Hut new big pizza sliders are here. Get nine in a box for just ten bucks. Ten bucks. Match up to three ways. Three? Cheese! Big, delicious sliders, only at your Pizza Hut. And that\u2019s how you make it great. Alright, so\u2026 so this airs during March Madness. Everyone sees it. The night this airs, friends send me text messages. \u201cHey, man, by any chance do you know how many pizza sliders you get in a box for just ten bucks?\u201d [laughter] \u201cNine!\u201d \u201cIs it true you can mix and match up to three ways?\u201d [laughter] \u201cYes, three. Yes.\u201d A buddy of mine sends me this screengrab. \u201cJust saw my high school prom date in a Pizza Hut ad.\u201d #throwback. #it\u2019s a small world. #brilliant. To which I reply, \u201cWe didn\u2019t end up going, though. How\u2019ve you been?\u201d #MrP. #Calc. To which she replies, \u201cI know! Made for a better tweet though. Let me know when you\u2019re in New York.\u201d To which I reply, \u201cabso-fucking-lutely.\u201d Now, against the advice of my therapist I go on Facebook, because she has a public profile. So I start clicking around. \u201cBethany Reed.\u201d Okay. \u201cLives in Manhattan.\u201d Duh, we knew that. \u201cIn a relationship with\u2026\u201d I click it. [audience gasps, applause] \u201cRajesh\u2026 Rengatramanajanana\u2026\u201d She is dating an Indian dude, and this dude is Indian as fuck. Look at his name! Look at how big his name is. It\u2019s so big, it barely fits in his Facebook profile. So big. Ten syllables. Ra-jesh Ren-gat-ra-ma-na-ja-na-nam. Are you kidding me? How many letters are in the alphabet? How many letters in the alphabet? 26 letters in the alphabet, right? How many letters are in Rajesh Rengatramanajananam? 25. That\u2019s one less letter than the entire alphabet. Come on! How easy is my name? Hasan Minhaj. So easy. She was like, \u201cFuck that. Give me the Rajesh Rengatramana\u2026 motherfucking-jananam.\u201d Like, \u201cNo!\u201d God is laughing at me. God is laughing at me. Now, against the advice of my therapist\u2026 I make contact. She\u2019s like, \u201cDo not make contact.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cTell me what I want to hear.\u201d \u201cNeed closure? Go for it.\u201d \u201cSee you next week.\u201d Therapy is bullshit. \u201cBethany, I\u2019ve got a gig in New York next week. I would love to meet up.\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s meet up.\u201d And I go from LA to New York, direct flight. Pizza Hut money. I\u2019m walking through New York. I\u2019m livid. I\u2019m pissed. How is this possible? How is this possible? Rajesh Rengatramana\u2026 How does she make love? \u201cOh, my God, Rajesh Rengatramanajananam, give it to me right now. Rajesh Rengatramanajananam, I want you so bad. Put your Rajesh in my Rengatramanajananam.\u201d I was like, \u201cStop it. Stop imagining her having sex with Rajesh Rengatramanajananam. You\u2019ve got leverage. Walk in there, be cool. Walk in there, be confident. Be like this, dude. Walk in there and just own it. Be like this, be like this.\u201d [laughter] [whistling, whooping] \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Do that with this, and then lick the lips and go, \u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d I\u2019m practicing it. I get to the door, open the door, then I hear, \u201cHey, Hasan!\u201d She\u2019s sitting outside. She saw me doing this shit in the street. [applause] I was like, \u201cOh, hey, what\u2019s up? Is someone sitting there? Cool.\u201d I just walk up and I\u2019m like, \u201cAlright, yeah. I\u2019ll just sit here, cool.\u201d I\u2019m sitting there. When you see someone from your past, all of a sudden, you\u2019re that age again. So all that Kanye juice just goes out of my body. I can\u2019t say anything. It\u2019s like the adults in Charlie Brown. I can\u2019t say anything. 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes. \u201cDude, are you going to be a darapok again? Say something.\u201d She starts talking about rent control and I cut her off. \u201cBethany, do you know why I\u2019m here? I\u2019m here to talk about prom.\u201d [laughter] And her face went white. You guys knew she was white, right? It went whiter than white. And I was like, \u201cYou knew my situation. You knew it. I was ride or die for you. At that age, that\u2019s a lot. You weren\u2019t the same for me, fine. Whatever. But what makes matters worse is, you had me socially crucified in front of everybody. You knew how hard it was for me, and then I was so insecure at that age that I couldn\u2019t date another white person, because I was afraid of not being able to be with them, because of the color of my skin. Do you know what that\u2019s like? And now, I\u2019m trying to pursue my dreams, I\u2019m trying, but now you\u2019re writing about me, you act like we\u2019re cool, when we\u2019re not. Why do you do that?\u201d And she was like, \u201cI am so sorry. But you know we were 18, right? Like, I really wanted to go with you. But my mom, she\u2019s very controlling. Do you know what it\u2019s like to have a parent that controls your life?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. What is that like? Do tell. I would love to hear that story.\u201d [cheering] \u201cTell me more.\u201d What? She\u2019s like, \u201cI wish I could have gone with you. But I can\u2019t change the past. I never thought you would want to talk to me ever again. But the reason why I write about you is because I see you kept your promise. So even if you never want to talk to me ever again, I\u2019ll always be rooting for you.\u201d You know how you carry hatred in your heart about people in your past? \u201cThey did this to me. Fuck them.\u201d Damn them. In that moment, I let it go. I crushed it like a Voldemort Horcrux. [makes crushing sounds] [cheering, applause] But I had to ask her the question that we\u2019re all thinking. [laughter] \u201cWhat about Mr Rengatramanajananam?\u201d She\u2019s like, \u201cI hit it off with this guy. We decide to move in together. I needed money for a deposit so I called my mom.\u201d \u201cWhat did your mom say?\u201d \u201cMy mom was like, \u2018No. You know the way our family is. So make up your mind.'\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cI told my mom, \u2018Not again. This isn\u2019t high school. Raj is a good person and so am I. So I\u2019m going to be with him because it\u2019s right. I hope you make up your mind.'\u201d And I\u2019m looking at her, and I\u2019m so embarrassed. I\u2019m like, \u201cDude, what are you doing? Why are you hunting down people from your past like a psycho? [laughter] You\u2019re not Liam Neeson. What is going on?\u201d I realized, \u201cYou don\u2019t give a shit about this person.\u201d I care about what she represents. Growing up, we just want that co-sign. To tell them you\u2019re good enough. \u201cSit here. You\u2019re good enough.\u201d But that\u2019s not the American dream. It\u2019s not asking for a co-sign. It\u2019s what every generation did before you. You claim that shit on your own terms. Pizza Hut pizza sliders. Nine in a box for just ten bucks. That\u2019s you. You\u2019re not Hasan Minhaj. You\u2019re \u201cHussan Minhajj\u201d. This is new brown America. The dream is for you to take, so take that shit. Stop blaming other people. [cheering, whooping]\nNow I\u2019m standing outside the restaurant and I can\u2019t even concentrate, because I know she\u2019s more evolved than me. She\u2019s like, \u201cNext time, me, you and Raj should hang out.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, let\u2019s not do that.\u201d And I\u2019m walking to the subway station. But I take one last look at the restaurant. Just to see her one last time. To know that generational change is possible with one choice. I turn around and I look, but she\u2019s gone. And I never saw her again. I did keep my promise, though. You know, I kept doing comedy. I never knew\u2026 I never knew if I would do anything more than Pizza Hut. You know how you hit that point when your parents give up on you and move on? \u201cLet\u2019s move on to Aisha.\u201d One day I get an email from my manager. \u201cWant to audition for The Daily Show?\u201d That\u2019s not a question. That\u2019s a statement. \u201cHey, audition for The Daily Show.\u201d I submit a tape. I get a call. \u201cJon Stewart saw your tape. Come to New York. They want you to audition. But, but\u2026 you have to write another original piece. Can you write another?\u201d \u201cNo, I can\u2019t. I\u2019m not Larry David. I can\u2019t do Seinfeld and Curb. I\u2019m a mere mortal.\u201d I\u2019m walking back and forth in my shitty one-bed apartment, like, \u201cI\u2019m going to die here.\u201d And it\u2019s amazing how racism will always happen to you when you need it the most. Like changing the oil on your car. \u201cOh, 15,000 miles. Racism.\u201d\nSo I\u2019m watching the show Real Time With Bill Maher. Have you guys seen Real Time With Bill Maher? You know Bill\u2019s demeanor. \u201cHey, do you believe in God? You\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d And everyone\u2019s like, \u201cOh, the atheist prophet speaks!\u201d So this clip went viral, him and Ben Affleck. Bill Maher is like, \u201cThese Muslims, 85 percent of them hate our freedom. We\u2019ve got to round them up, we\u2019ve got to contain them.\u201d And Ben Affleck\u2019s like, \u201cAre you crazy? Round them up, contain them? Dude, we did that to the Japanese. You can\u2019t do that. Am I crazy?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, you\u2019re not crazy. You\u2019re my white prince.\u201d [laughter, applause] Don\u2019t you realize what happened in that moment? We got our first A-list celebrity to back the Muslim community. We got Batman, baby! \u201cHe may not be the hero we want, but he is the hero the Muslim world needs.\u201d \u201cBatman versus Bill Maher.\u201d I write the piece, go to New York. You get it, right? The producer answers the door: \u201cAudition with me. When you\u2019re ready, Jon will come down. Run it with me.\u201d We\u2019re walking down the hallway, and I see all these photos of the old correspondents that came before me. Steve Carell, John Oliver, Sam Bee, Jason Jones, Ed Helms, Steven Colbert\u2026 and me? Keema roti, me? You know we don\u2019t end up this far. You know the way it is. Middle management till we die. We\u2019re not on that stage, ever. I walk in and I see that Daily Show globe. I can\u2019t tell you how blue it is. And now I\u2019m sweating through my suit. The producer is like, \u201cWe\u2019ll run it a few times.\u201d And I sit down and I get to the desk. Sitting presidents have sat on that desk. I sit down and we\u2019re running it, and I\u2019m nervous. He goes, \u201cHey, man, just slow down. Alright?\u201d We run it a second time. Now I\u2019m stuttering. And he goes, \u201cHey, man, relax. You\u2019re funny.\u201d Which is a tell-tale sign of being, like, \u201cHey, man. You\u2019re not funny. You shouldn\u2019t relax.\u201d And I can feel it. I\u2019m choking. We\u2019ve all been there. Everyone\u2019s, \u201cHow did it go?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cPositive thoughts.\u201d No, it\u2019s not happening. You\u2019re not. You are choking. MCAT, DAT, you\u2019re going to the Caribbean, it\u2019s a wrap. You choked, right? Too real? It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve all been there. And I can feel this turtle head coming out of my butt. I\u2019m really nervous. I\u2019m pooping my pants. I\u2019m like, \u201cNo!\u201d Then I hear\u2026 [sings Daily Show theme] I know that voice. It\u2019s Jewish Yoda. It\u2019s Jon. He\u2019s walking through the tunnel where the guests come, so he\u2019s just back-lit. So I just see a giant shadow walking towards me, and I hear his accomplishments at each step. \u201cBoom! I am Jon Stewart. Boom! Twenty-two-time Emmy-award-winning Jon Stewart. Boom! I redefined political satire and comedy. What have you done?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cHave you heard of Pizza Hut?\u201d [laughter] [applause, whooping] Then he steps into the light, and he\u2019s shorter than I thought. And he has all this scruff on his face. And I look at him, and I\u2019m like\u2026 \u201cDad?\u201d He had Jewish Najmi vibes. He shakes my hand. I could feel it, like he\u2019d slapped me in a previous life. I was like, \u201cI know this hand!\u201d He starts riffing, I start riffing. The prompter guy: \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d \u201cI got this.\u201d I had it all memorized. One shot, Eight Mile. And I stuck my landing like a Russian gymnast. \u201cThank you for the opportunity.\u201d I tucked that turtle head back in my butt. \u201cWe\u2019re going home.\u201d I walk out the door, but then I hear a voice. \u201cHey, man, where are you going?\u201d And it\u2019s Jon. I was like, \u201cOh, I live in LA. I\u2019ve got to go back to LA.\u201d \u201cWell, I\u2019ll see you Monday, right?\u201d I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWell, you work here. So I\u2019ll see you Monday, right?\u201d [huge cheer] I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was like, \u201cOscar speech, go. Say what you got to say.\u201d What I wanted to say was, \u201cJon, this is one of the only things that I\u2019ve gotten in my entire career that my dad actually knows.\u201d [laughter] \u201cSo thank you.\u201d But what I said was, \u201cJon! My dad\u2026 knows you!\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sure he does.\u201d I pinch myself. \u201cYou\u2019re Hasan Minhaj. You\u2019re going to be on The Daily Show.\u201d I run outside. I call my girl. She\u2019s crying. I call my mom, she\u2019s crying. I call my dad, he says \u201cGood job.\u201d \u201cWhat? \u2018Good job\u2019? Say it again. I can\u2019t hear you, Dad. Say it.\u201d A car almost hits me. I\u2019m, like, \u201cNo! I can\u2019t die. I\u2019ve got to drop the greatest status update.\u201d I run upstairs, open my laptop, fire up Facebook, and then I see this. [audience gasps, moans] [quiet laughter] You guys see this, right? [laughter] Don\u2019t you know what this means? Don\u2019t you get it? I\u2019m the cure for racism. [laughter, applause] I cured it. Alright, maybe I didn\u2019t cure it, but everyone has a purpose. Some people were put here to find a cure for cancer, or find a vaccine for Ebola. My life is definitive proof that once you go brown, you\u2019ve got to lock that shit down. [huge cheer, applause] Thank you. Thank you. Good night. Be well. God bless. I love you guys. I love you guys. Good night. I love you. [whistling, whooping]","jim":"[Car horn honks] [Audience cheering] [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Mr. Jim Jefferies! [Upbeat music playing] Hello! Sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down, sit down. [Chuckles] Thank you, Boston. I appreciate that. [Whooping] Uh, that\u2019s very sweet of you. [Man] Love you! I\u2019m at the end of the tour right now. I\u2019m very happy to be on tour because I now have a child. Ah, so\u2026 any time out of home is good for me. Um, I got my girlfriend pregnant after knowing her for two months. So\u2026 [Audience cheering] Thank you. Thank you. Life decisions. And she\u2019s a nice girl, and I love her in a way, sure. My problem with my girlfriend is, she\u2019s very sweet, but she\u2019s shit at telling stories, and I\u2019m awesome at telling stories, so it really bothers me when she talks. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019ll be a problem in the future, but it\u2019s a problem now and I don\u2019t see it getting better. Um\u2026 I\u2019ll give you an example, right? I was in the car, and my son Hank was asleep in the back seat, and we\u2019re driving along, and on the radio comes Madonna, and my girlfriend just slips into conversation, \u201cOh, I used to party with Madonna.\u201d And I went, \u201cYou fucking what, when?\u201d And she went, \u201cI used to party with Madonna.\u201d Now, I should fill you in a little bit on this. My girlfriend used to be a model in Miami, right? I\u2019m not bragging. I didn\u2019t get the model years. I didn\u2019t get those years. I\u2019ve seen the photos. Very impressive. Um\u2026 So, I said, \u201cSo you used to party with Madonna. Madonna used to have big parties and invite models over, right?\u201d And she went, \u201cNo, no, it would just be me and a few other people.\u201d I go, \u201cYou need to elaborate on this story right now.\u201d And she goes, \u201cOh, okay, I used to date the center for the Miami Heat.\u201d As soon as you hear that the mother of your child used to date an NBA center, even if this guy\u2019s even slightly in proportion\u2026 a lot of things flood through your head. First thing is, \u201cThat\u2019s why your cunt\u2019s so fucked up.\u201d That\u2019s a big one. \u201cThat\u2019s why our child came out while you were walking. I understand.\u201d So she said, \u201cI used to date the center for the Miami Heat. His best friend was Dennis Rodman. Dennis Rodman used to go out with Madonna, and we used to go over to Madonna\u2019s house.\u201d And she goes, \u201cThis one time, the four of us were over at Madonna\u2019s house, and we were all fucked up on drugs, and one thing led to another\u2026\u201d And then I went, \u201cShut the fuck up!\u201d And she went, \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cI know what \u2018one thing led to another\u2019 means! You all started fucking each other!\u201d And she went, \u201cWe did. We started\u2026\u201d \u201cJust shut up!\u201d And she goes, \u201cWhat do you care for?\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re the mother of my child! I don\u2019t wanna picture you being fucked by a 7\u20192\u2033 NBA player while you\u2019re licking out Madonna\u2019s muscular vagina and Dennis Rodman is in the corner stroking his tattooed cock, going\u2026\u201d [Moaning] And she goes, \u201cOh, you\u2019re being silly. What do you care for? You\u2019ve partied way more than I have in my life.\u201d And I went, \u201cThat is not true. I\u2019ve gotten wasted way more than you have, but I have, in no way, partied way more than you have. Often, I get wasted just by myself. I wouldn\u2019t call it a party.\u201d For most of my career, I was a struggling comedian, right? And this is how struggling comedians party, right? It\u2019s 5:00 a.m., Monday, right? We\u2019re in a one-bedroom apartment. Seven of us are standing around a coffee table, trying to stretch out two grams of coke. One of us is at the end of the table giving conspiracy theories\u2026 and the rest of us are talking about where women might be. One of us has come up with a plan. The plan goes like this, \u201cWell\u2026 nurses will be finishing their shift soon. Maybe if we just stand out the front of the ER, they\u2019ll appreciate seven funny guys.\u201d [Chuckles] I don\u2019t\u2026 You know, I\u2019ve never partied like a model. I have partied twice in my life. Twice. Like, really partied. I\u2019ve had good nights out, but I\u2019ve really partied twice. If you really party, and most people never experience this, it\u2019s an amazing thing. It happens in Vegas. It can only happen in Vegas, and it\u2019s gotta involve celebrity, right? I\u2019m not famous, but the people around me were super famous, and I was at this party in the night club, and they took me in. And then there\u2019s the night club, but then there\u2019s the real night club out the back, which is, like, the size of this stage. It\u2019s only a little room. And you go back there and you can just\u2026 They encourage you to take drugs in the open, and you\u2019re just doing it off a key, [Sniffs] and they\u2019re going, \u201cNo, dude. Use the table. Don\u2019t use your\u2026\u201d And I go, \u201cOh, oh. Oh, sorry. Um\u2026\u201d And it\u2019s confusing at first, and then their security will drag women off that other night club into your room. Just bring \u2019em in like, \u201cHuh?\u201d And you can do this. You can go\u2026 \u201cUh\u2026\u201d Like that. And they\u2019ll drag these women away. It is the best thing you\u2019ll ever do with your life. When you party that hard as a man, there\u2019s a lot of remorse \u2019cause you have to tip everyone a lot of money. You wake up in the morning with a terrible hangover, and you go to your friends. You go, \u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I spent $5,000.\u201d When a hot girl parties that hard, she wakes up in the morning and goes, \u201cOh, my God. We partied so hard last night. I made $5,000.\u201d And that\u2019s a vastly different emotion that\u2026 I don\u2019t think women will never\u2026 Yeah, okay. This is the thing. In America, at the moment, they\u2019re trying to raise the minimum wage to, I don\u2019t know, $16 an hour or something like that, and whenever they bring up this argument, they always go, \u201cAnd still to this day, women only earn 70% of what men earn in the workplace.\u201d And of course, that\u2019s disgusting. How dare women earn so much? Like\u2026 a lot of things that I say tonight will be jokes that I don\u2019t actually mean, but this is something I\u2019m really passionate about. Women do not deserve to earn as much money as men in the workplace. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2026 [Audience whooping] I\u2019m not being a misogynistic bastard, right? I\u2019m not saying that women don\u2019t work as hard. I\u2019m sure they do. I\u2019m not saying they don\u2019t do as good a job. What I\u2019m saying is they don\u2019t deserve to earn as much money as men. Right? Men need that extra 30% to buy meals and drinks and Jim Jefferies tickets and all that shit! [Audience cheering] Now\u2026 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s women in this room that are saying, \u201cOh, I pay for my drinks. I bought my own ticket.\u201d And don\u2019t think we don\u2019t appreciate the uglies, \u2019cause we do. Right? We do. But there\u2019s little things in society that you can\u2019t change. Men have extra expenses that you\u2019ll never understand. There\u2019s holidays that are just for women. Like Valentine\u2019s Day is just for women. They say it\u2019s for romantics. They say it\u2019s for couples or something like that. It\u2019s just for women. There\u2019s no man who gets excited by Valentine\u2019s Day. There\u2019s no man that when he sees the Valentine\u2019s Day decorations go up in the shopping mall, he goes, \u201cOh, Valentine\u2019s Day is coming!\u201d Valentine\u2019s Day is a mathematical equation that every man has in his head, and it goes like this, \u201cHow much money do I have to spend today so that you won\u2019t act like a cunt?\u201d It doesn\u2019t stop there. Mother\u2019s Day! Mother\u2019s Day rocked around in my house when my son was six months old. My girlfriend\u2019s first Mother\u2019s Day. And she went, \u201cOh, I wonder what I\u2019ll get for Mother\u2019s Day.\u201d And I went, \u201cProbably fucking nothing. He\u2019s got no money. He\u2019s six months old. What do you think he\u2019s gonna buy you?\u201d Within an hour, her friends were over at the house, just by coincidence, telling me what a bad person I was and how important Mother\u2019s Day is to a new mum, you know? And so, I went and bought her a cappuccino machine \u2019cause I assumed that\u2019s what Hank would have wanted her to have\u2026 and I wrote a card. I\u2019m not a bastard. I wrote a card. I\u2019m right-handed. So I got my left hand. Every new dad knows this. You get the crayon and you go, [Imitating child] \u201cHappy Mother\u2019s Day. Love, Hank.\u201d And I went, \u201cH-A-N\u2026\u201d And then I did the \u201cK\u201d back-to-front because he\u2019s a fucking moron. See, now I know there\u2019s people in the room, they\u2019re thinking, \u201cWell, fathers have Father\u2019s Day.\u201d Father\u2019s Day is bullshit. It\u2019s fucking shit, Father\u2019s Day. Father\u2019s Day came around and my girlfriend went, \u201cWhat do you want for Father\u2019s Day?\u201d And I went, \u201cI don\u2019t want anything. Don\u2019t even worry about it. I don\u2019t want anything.\u201d And she goes, \u201cCome on. You gotta have something.\u201d I said, \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t want anything.\u201d And she goes, \u201cCome on.\u201d And I went, \u201cIt\u2019s my fucking money. Just don\u2019t touch it. Just leave my money alone. How hard is this? How about, for 24 hours, you don\u2019t touch my fucking money? That would be a gift.\u201d That\u2019s why every single father has that one Father\u2019s Day gift that they cherish, and it\u2019s shit! It\u2019s, like, a fucking ceramic mug that the kid made in school where the handle\u2019s too big, and it says, \u201cI heart Dad.\u201d And they keep that for 20 fucking years, this mug. And do you wanna know why they like it? Every now and again, they look at it and go\u2026 \u201cThat cost me nothing, that mug.\u201d [Audience whooping] See\u2026 wouldn\u2019t it be nice to have one day that was for men and for fathers and all that type of stuff, but didn\u2019t cost anything, that everyone could participate in, right? I\u2019ve got it, right? April 18th\u2026 Anal Sex Day. [Men cheering loudly] It\u2019s good, isn\u2019t it? Everyone\u2019s girlfriend or wife has to take it in the ass on April 18th. It\u2019s nice. A month before, you\u2019d be walking around the shopping center going, \u201cOh, the decorations are up!\u201d [Men whooping] And it\u2019s good \u2019cause if your bird didn\u2019t take it in the ass, you could do the same thing that women do on Valentine\u2019s Day when they don\u2019t get a gift. You could go like, \u201cOh, me mate, Jason, his wife took it in the ass twice. Yeah, obviously, they\u2019re more connected than we are. They\u2019ve, uh\u2026\u201d I\u2019m thinking, I don\u2019t do much merchandise after my shows and stuff, but I\u2019m thinking of bringing out some April 18th T-shirts. Not even putting \u201cJim Jefferies\u201d on them or anything. Just T-shirts that say, \u201cApril 18th.\u201d \u2018Cause it\u2019s good, right? You\u2019re in a bar. You\u2019re a guy. You see a guy at the other end of the bar with an April 18th, and you go\u2026 Fucking friends for life, right? But even better, you see a girl with an April 18th T-shirt. The weird thing is I\u2019m bigging-up anal sex here, and I don\u2019t even really like fucking girls in the ass that much. I\u2019m not even a huge fan. I much prefer the cunt. I think it\u2019s a much more\u2026 I think that a cunt is a much more purpose-built thing to fuck. But, you know, anal sex\u2026 Oh, you know\u2026 I do it. I get involved, \u2019cause I feel like I have to. You know, I\u2026 But I\u2019ve never been a big fan of the ass fucking, I, uh\u2026 When I watch it on porn, it seems very inviting. The girl\u2019s taking it so fluently in her ass, and she seems to be having fun, and, uh\u2026 But the thing is, you can\u2019t smell porn. You don\u2019t smell porn. You just\u2026 You just watch it. They never\u2026 And it\u2019s different, porn. It\u2019s different. They clean the girl\u2019s asshole. They pump water into it until it\u2019s very hygienic. I\u2019m sure. And the girl seems to be so happy. She\u2019s like\u2026 You\u2019ve got it in her pussy, you\u2019re fucking her, and then she\u2019s like, \u201cPut it in my ass.\u201d She\u2019s inviting. It\u2019s like you\u2019re doing her a favor in porn. And then she\u2019s like\u2026 She says things\u2026 I don\u2019t know, things like, \u201cI\u2019m enjoying that. Keep putting it in my ass. Fuck my ass. I love a cock in my ass.\u201d And\u2026 And the experience I\u2019ve had in my own life has been vastly different. I\u2019ve\u2026 My experience has been a lot of crying. Now, although that can help you come at times, it\u2019s not what you want\u2026 It\u2019s not what you want for every day. I like the girl who acts like she\u2019s enjoying it. Like, you know when your girlfriend\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna act like I enjoy it.\u201d She does that whole, \u201cYeah. Oh, no, that\u2019s good.\u201d [Moaning] Ahh! \u266a I\u2019m having a good time \u266a And then they\u2019re always going, \u201cAre you done? Are you close to done?\u201d You never fuck a pussy and they go, \u201cAre you almost done? Finish this.\u201d Like that. If you\u2019re fucking ass, they don\u2019t want you\u2026 They want it all over, quick. And they do other things, the porn girls. I don\u2019t know how much they get paid. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more than what the men get paid. It\u2019s the opposite bit of society. Um\u2026 But they do a thing called \u201cATM.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you know what that is, kids. That stands for \u201cass to mouth.\u201d That\u2019s where the porn girl will pull the cock from out of her anus, and she\u2019ll put it directly in her mouth, and she\u2019ll say something like, \u201cI love the taste of my ass. Let me taste my ass.\u201d And then the man, as a favor to this woman, puts his cock in her mouth to congratulate her on the fine work\u2026 [Applause] she\u2019s been doing. Now, I had a drunken night with my ex-girlfriend where she thought she\u2019d be all wild and try that. Once again, vastly different experience. I\u2019m not a big fan of the ass fucking, and I don\u2019t know of any man, if they\u2019re truthful, really is. Now, there\u2019s women in the room who are thinking, \u201cWell, why does my guy constantly bother me to fuck me in my ass?\u201d [Woman shouting] What a good question. [Woman whoops] Women, the reason that men like fucking you in the ass is because\u2026 we know you fucking hate it. [Cheering] So\u2026 I\u2019m a father. Um\u2026 I love my son! I love my son the same way that I love cigarettes. I like to hold him for five minutes every hour, and the rest of the time, I\u2019m thinking about how he\u2019s fucking killing me. He\u2019s a good little boy. No, he\u2019s a great little fella. I really like him. Um\u2026 My girlfriend super loves him, though. It\u2019s fucking creepy. And\u2026 I\u2019m glad I have a son. That worked out good for me. I wouldn\u2019t be a good father to a girl. It wouldn\u2019t be good for me. Nothing weird. Wouldn\u2019t fuck it. I\u2026 I just don\u2019t get along with women. You know how it is. I don\u2019t want them in my house, and\u2026 So\u2026 Because you dream, see\u2026 For example, okay? When Hank was born\u2026 the couple over the road, within two weeks of Hank being born, had a baby girl, and rightly or wrongly, the first thing that went through my head was\u2026 \u201cAw, that\u2019s great. I hope Hank fucks that one day.\u201d That\u2019s what I think\u2026 \u2018Cause that\u2019s what I think about my son. I hope when he\u2019s of age, he just fucks everything. I don\u2019t care if my son is gay or straight. All I care about is, when he is of age, that he gets every bit of fucking pussy or cock that he desires. That is my dream for my son! [Audience cheering] But never in the history of fathers and daughters, has a father held his baby girl and gone, \u201cOh, I hope you have a lot of cocks through you in your life. I hope you\u2019re never shy of a cock. I hope you pass out at parties and all the boys are queuing up.\u201d Right, you know\u2026 And it\u2019s not just me. Women treat baby girls and baby boys differently as well. My girlfriend goes to the gym every morning. I go there very occasionally, and when you go to the gym, there\u2019s a little daycare cr\u00e8che thing in the gym where you can hand your child off, and inside that daycare, there\u2019s, like, three women in their 50s. They\u2019re very nice ladies, and you hand your kid off and he plays. Then when you finish your workout, you come and get him. And there\u2019s a woman that works there who just loves my son. She sees all the other kids, but she loves Hank, and Hank fucking loves her, and the two of them light up when they see each other. And it\u2019s super cute, I bring Hank up the stairs, and he starts going, \u201cUh, uh!\u201d Trying to reach at her, all right? And she does this, she goes, \u201cEveryone, my boyfriend\u2019s here. Here\u2019s my boyfriend. Give him here. He\u2019s my boyfriend.\u201d And then she kisses him, and she goes, \u266a My boyfriend gives me kisses My boyfriend gives me kisses \u266a It\u2019s fucking adorable. But I tried doing that with a baby girl\u2026 Let\u2019s say you go to the gym and there\u2019s a daycare, and me and a couple of my mates are working there. \u201cHey, everyone\u2026 me girlfriend\u2019s here. Give her here. Give her here. She\u2019s my girlfriend. My girlfriend gives me kisses. You know that, right? She\u2019s always giving me kisses. Enjoy your workout. Don\u2019t worry about a thing.\u201d [Applause] [Cheering] So\u2026 Also\u2026 it\u2019s just easier to bring up a son than it is a daughter. It\u2019s just little things. Even when they\u2019re babies, it\u2019s just easier. There\u2019s a wiping technique when you\u2019re wiping a baby\u2019s ass. I don\u2019t know if you have children, but this is how you do it. The baby lays on its back. You put their feet together. You lift the feet up, and then you go in and wipe. With a boy, you can wipe like that. Up and down, side to side, whatever the fuck you want, right? With a girl, you gotta wipe downward and away. Downward and away. It\u2019s very important that you wipe away from the cunt. Very important. \u2018Cause it turns out that women of all ages hate having shit in their cunts. They do. They fucking hate it. Boys don\u2019t give a shit. Fucking\u2026 My son will have shit all over his dick and balls, and I\u2019ll be cleaning it off under the foreskin, and he\u2019ll be laughing like it\u2019s the best day ever. Even at my age now, I find it funny if I have shit on my dick. If I fuck my girlfriend in the ass, I pull out, I\u2019ve got shit on my dick, I\u2019ll ring me mate Jason up and go, \u201cHey, Jason\u2026 It\u2019s happened again. I got shit on my dick.\u201d And he\u2019ll tell me a similar story about when he had shit on his dick, and we\u2019ll laugh and laugh and laugh. But never in the history of women has there been a woman with shit in her cunt and she\u2019s thought, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t wait to call Karen.\u201d [Chuckles] [Laughs] When you\u2026 When my girlfriend got pregnant\u2026 When you meet\u2026 When you haven\u2019t got a child, couples who have children are always bragging about how cool it is to have children. Whenever you meet couples with children they\u2019re always like, \u201cIt is the most fulfilling thing I\u2019ve ever done with my life. My heart grows larger and larger every day.\u201d And then the second that my girlfriend got pregnant, those same people went like this, \u201cYou\u2019re never gonna sleep again! [Laughs maniacally] Forget about it. It\u2019s over. You\u2019re not gonna sleep.\u201d They\u2019re constantly telling you you\u2019re not gonna sleep. Raising a baby is not that hard. I\u2019ll tell you what, it\u2019s easier than a coke habit. I had a coke habit for seven-and-a-half fucking years! At least it\u2019s not me who wakes up crying anymore! I can sleep through other people crying. I\u2019ve had girlfriends. That\u2019s like white noise to me. I find it soothing. See, me and my girlfriend, just two months, we went, \u201cFuck it! Let\u2019s have a kid.\u201d Fucking did it, right? These other people, man\u2026 You know these couples, and they date from high school, and then they go out for a bit longer, and then after being together for like, seven years, they go, \u201cWe\u2019re getting engaged. You wanna come to the party?\u201d And you wanna say, \u201cNo, you\u2019re really boring and we hate you.\u201d But you go, \u201cOh, okay, great. You\u2019re still together, are you? You fucked one person, have you? Oh, how exciting.\u201d And\u2026 And then what they do is they don\u2019t have a kid right away because they\u2019re still not ready. \u201cWe have to see how our careers are going and shit.\u201d And what they do is they get a dog, and then they act like the fucking dog\u2019s their baby. They refer to it as their fucking baby. They send you a Christmas card of them holding the dog\u2026 and it says, \u201cFrom our family to yours.\u201d And then you have a barbecue, and you invite them, the humans, right? Then they come over. This fucking dog runs in, jumping over everything, and you\u2019re like, \u201cWhat the fuck is this shit?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWe had to bring him. We bring our baby everywhere.\u201d And you go, \u201cWell, your baby is biting my actual baby. Can you control\u2026\u201d And then, eventually, they decide they\u2019re gonna have a kid \u2019cause they\u2019ve learned so much from the dog, and then they bring the kid back, and the dog runs up, like, \u201cWhat\u2019s happening? A new person.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cFuck off. We don\u2019t love you anymore. We\u2019re going.\u201d And they think they\u2019ve learnt something from the dog, and they haven\u2019t learnt anything. What happens if your girlfriend\u2019s away on work and the dog dies? You go off, you buy another dog that looks similar to the original dog\u2026 try to pass it off as the same dog. What happens if your girlfriend\u2019s away on work and the baby dies? Very hard\u2026 to get a baby that looks exactly the same in the short period of time that you have. Easier if you\u2019re black or Asian. [Audience cheering] Boston, no! No! No! Shut up! I will not put up with racism at my shows, okay? I\u2019m not saying \u2019cause they look the same. I\u2019m saying \u2019cause they\u2019re easier to purchase. [Audience cheering] [Audience whooping] If Angelina Jolie and Madonna have taught us anything\u2026 it is that you can buy black and Asian people. I\u2019m yet to see a black celebrity couple come home from Norway with a child, going\u2026 \u201cYolanda, quick, get Hans. Bring him over. Come on.\u201d [Jeffries chuckles] I\u2019m gonna talk about something now that sort of splits the crowd a little bit. Uh\u2026 Gun control. Now\u2026 No, wait. Before you\u2026 Don\u2019t get excited because the other people have guns. The anti-gun people are like, \u201cYeah! Do it, Jim!\u201d No, let\u2019s just\u2026 [Shushes] Now, before I start saying this, I wanna say this, right? I believe in your right as Americans to have guns. I\u2019m not trying to stop you from having guns. All I\u2019m saying is this is my personal belief on the opinion. My opinion on the\u2026 Oh, it doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t like guns, right? I\u2019m gonna say some things that are just facts, right? In Australia, we had guns, right? Right up until 1996. In 1996, Australia had the biggest massacre on Earth. It still hasn\u2019t been beaten. And\u2026 Now, after that, they banned the guns. Now, in the 10 years before Port Arthur, there was 10 massacres. Since the gun ban in 1996, there hasn\u2019t been a single massacre since. I don\u2019t know how or why this happened, uh\u2026 Maybe it was a coincidence, right? Now, please understand that I understand that Australia and America are two vastly different cultures with different people, right? I get it. In Australia, we had the biggest massacre on Earth, and the Australian government went, \u201cThat\u2019s it! No more guns!\u201d And we all went, \u201cYeah, all right, then. That seems fair enough, really.\u201d Now, in America, you had the Sandy Hook massacre where little, tiny children died, and your government went, \u201cMaybe\u2026 we\u2019ll get rid of the big guns?\u201d And 50% of you went, \u201cFuck you! Don\u2019t take my guns!\u201d [Whooping] So, here\u2019s where it gets confusing, right? Now, as I said, I am all for your Second Amendment rights. I think you should be able to have guns. It\u2019s in your constitution. What I am not for is bullshit arguments and lies. There is one argument and one argument alone for having a gun, and this is the argument\u2026 \u201cFuck off. I like guns.\u201d It\u2019s not the best argument, but it\u2019s all you\u2019ve got. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with it. There\u2019s nothing wrong with saying, \u201cI like something. Don\u2019t take it away from me.\u201d But don\u2019t give me this other bullshit. The main one is, [In American accent] \u201cI need it for protection. I need to protect me. I need to protect my family.\u201d Really? Is that why they\u2019re called \u201cassault rifles\u201d? Is it? I\u2019ve never heard of these fucking \u201cprotection rifles\u201d you speak of. Protection? What the fuck are you talking about? You have a gun in your house, you\u2019re 80% more likely to use that gun on yourself, than to shoot someone else. And people think, \u201cWell, that\u2019d never happen to me.\u201d You don\u2019t know that, because you know what?\n\u266a From time to time We all get sad \u266a \n\u266a One day you\u2019re happy Then you\u2019re sad \u266a \n\u266a And then, uh-oh \u266a\nProtection. I had a break-in in Manchester, England, where I was tied up, I had my head cut. They threatened to rape my girlfriend. They came through the window with a machete and a hammer, and Americans always go, [In American accent] \u201cWell, imagine if you had a gun.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cAll right. I was naked at the time. I wasn\u2019t wearing my holster. I wasn\u2019t staring at the window waiting for cunts with machetes to come through.\u201d What world do you live in where you\u2019re constantly fucking ready? You have guns \u2019cause you like guns! That\u2019s why you go to gun conventions! That\u2019s why you read gun magazines! None of you give a shit about home security. None of you go to home security conventions. None of you read Padlock Monthly. None of you have a Facebook picture of you behind a secure door going, \u201cFucking yeah!\u201d Like you\u2019re going to be ready if someone comes into your house. You have it at all fucking times. By the way, most people who are breaking into your house just want your fucking TV! You think that people are coming to murder your family? How many fucking enemies do you have? Jeez, you think a lot of yourself if you think everyone\u2019s coming to murder you. See, if you have it readily available, it becomes unsafe. You have it in your bedside table, one of your kids picks it up, thinks it\u2019s a toy, shoots another one of your kids. Happens every fucking day, but people go, \u201cThat\u2019d never happen in my house \u2019cause I\u2019m a responsible gun owner. I keep my guns locked in a safe.\u201d Then they\u2019re no fucking protection! Someone comes into the house, you\u2019re like, \u201cWait there, fuck-face! Oh! You\u2019ve come to the wrong house here, buddy boy. I tell you what. I\u2019m gonna fuck you up! Okay. Is it 32 to the left or 32 to the right? Your mother\u2019s birthday? Why the fuck would I know your fucking mother\u2019s birthday? Maybe if you didn\u2019t leave the window open [In whining voice] \u2018because it\u2019s too hot in here,\u2019 we wouldn\u2019t be getting fucking murdered, right?\u201d I find the NRA to be hard work. The fact that they always think the answer is more guns. After Sandy Hook happened, the NRA said, and I quote, \u201cNone of this would have happened if the teachers had guns.\u201d I\u2026 I think they\u2019re forgetting what school was like. Does anyone remember that casual teacher that used to\u2026 Whenever she came into school, that relief teacher came, you and your friends would see her and go, [Chuckling] \u201cOh, we\u2019re gonna make her cry.\u201d And then she\u2019d stand in front of the class with a bit of chalk and her hands would be shaking, and you\u2019d go, \u201cYou\u2019re never getting married, are you, Miss? Never gonna happen for you.\u201d Then she\u2019d get back to her 1967 Volkswagen Beetle, and she\u2019d be crying over the steering wheel, just, \u201cWhy don\u2019t they like me?\u201d Let\u2019s give that cunt a gun and see how things work out! [Audience cheering] And then they go, \u201cOh, well, answer to that, we\u2019ll just add more guns.\u201d They go, \u201cWe\u2019ll put an armed security guard at every school across America.\u201d Yeah, that\u2019ll work out. The average security guard in America earns $16 an hour. Not a lot of wiggle room to be a fucking hero! Someone comes onto the school and\u2026 [Mimicking machine gun] And you\u2019ve got Kevin. Now, I\u2019m sure Kevin\u2019s shit-hot at Call of Duty, but it might not fucking cut it, ladies and gentlemen. Now, I understand that when I\u2019m doing this joke in this room, 50% of you agree with me, 50% of you don\u2019t agree with me, and I do respect the people who don\u2019t agree with me. Don\u2019t think I don\u2019t. Out of the 50% that don\u2019t agree with me, 20% of those people are smart enough to realize this is a comedy show and it\u2019s not to be taken seriously, and they\u2019re laughing along \u2019cause it\u2019s just funny jokes, right? And then the next 20%, have sort of phased out a little bit. They\u2019re looking around, going, \u201cWonder how they got that chandelier up there?\u201d And then\u2026 there\u2019s the last 10%. And they\u2019re fucking furious. Right now, in this room and the people watching at home\u2026 10% of you are fucking seething. Just\u2026 And for a couple of reasons. First reason, I\u2019m making good points. [Audience cheering] Second reason. Second reason. Second reason, and this is the big one, I\u2019m foreign\u2026 and that\u2019s pissing the fuck out of you right now, and your brain is on a loop and you can\u2019t fucking turn it off, and it\u2019s just going around in a circle, and you\u2019re just going, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, go home! If you don\u2019t like it, go home!\u201d And my answer to that is, \u201cNo.\u201d I came here legally. I pay my taxes. I\u2019ll say whatever the fuck I want. Your First Amendment means that I can say the Second Amendment sucks dicks. And\u2026 unless you\u2019re an American Indian, you\u2019re a fucking immigrant as well, so fuck off. People get so precious about it. I understand that to Americans, your constitution is very important. I respect it, but please understand that every country has one as well. It\u2019s no more special than any other constitution. We have one in Australia. I don\u2019t know what it says. I\u2019ve never seen it. If there\u2019s a problem, we\u2019ll check it, but everything\u2019s going fine. And don\u2019t get me wrong. I get that the constitution is important to you. I have had\u2026 Fucking, I get it, right? I\u2019ve had people come up to me in my face and scream at me in car parks as I\u2019m leaving the theater, going, [In American accent] \u201cYou cannot change the Second Amendment!\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cYes, you can. It\u2019s called an \u2018amendment.'\u201d If you can\u2019t change something that\u2019s called an \u201camendment\u201d, see, many of you need a thesaurus more than you need a constitution. And if you don\u2019t know what a thesaurus is, get a dictionary and work your way forward. Don\u2019t think your constitution is set in stone. You\u2019ve changed things before. You used to have prohibition in there, right? And then people were like, \u201cHey, who likes getting fucked up? Yeah, I like getting fucked up, too. Let\u2019s get that one out. Let\u2019s get that one out.\u201d You used to have this other thing in America called, uh\u2026 slavery! And then Lincoln came along and went, \u201cThat\u2019s it. No more slaves!\u201d And 50% of you went, \u201cFuck you! Don\u2019t take my slaves!\u201d And the same bullshit arguments came out that you have with guns. \u201cWhy should I have my slaves taken off me? I\u2019m a responsible slave owner. I\u2019m trained in how to use my slaves safely. Just because that guy mistreated his slaves doesn\u2019t mean that my rights should be taken away from me. I\u2026 I use my slaves to protect my family! I keep my slaves locked in a safe!\u201d That\u2019s the thing. \u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me? I\u2019ve done nothing wrong.\u201d Look, I agree with you. If you\u2019re a responsible gun owner and you don\u2019t fuck around with them, then you should be allowed your guns. You really should. But that\u2019s not how society works. We have to play to the 1% that are such fuckwits they ruin it for the rest of us. We have to walk as slow as our slowest person to keep society fucking moving, right? I take drugs like a fucking champion, right? [Audience cheering] We should all be allowed to take fucking drugs, but we can\u2019t, can we? Because Sarah took drugs and she stabbed her fucking kids. Oh! \u201cOh, thanks, Sarah. You fucked it up for everyone.\u201d Right? Everyone should be allowed to drive their car as fast as they can do it, right? But we can\u2019t because Jonathan got drunk and ran over a family. \u201cThanks, Jonathan! Now I have to drive at 30, you fucking idiot!\u201d See, that\u2019s the thing. \u201cWhy should I have my guns taken off me, I\u2019m responsible, just because that guy\u2019s crazy?\u201d Who\u2019s to say you\u2019re not crazy? That\u2019s the thing about crazy people. They don\u2019t know they\u2019re crazy. That\u2019s what makes them crazy. The only thing you know for sure on this Earth is, \u201cI think, therefore I am.\u201d You know that you exist. Anything past that is open to interpretation, right? You know you exist and that\u2019s it. Right now, I think I\u2019m in Boston talking to 1,200 people. That\u2019s what I think I\u2019m doing, but there is a good to fair chance that I\u2019m in a mental home, standing in front of a white wall, going, [Slurring speech] \u201cI hate guns. I hate guns. I hate guns.\u201d [Audience applauding] See, one of the better arguments is, \u201cWell, if you take the guns away, then only the criminals will have guns.\u201d Not true. When they banned the guns in Australia, it worked. When they banned them in Britain, it worked, okay? The Bushmaster gun that the kid was gonna use in Sandy Hook costs, like, $1,000 American and you can buy it in Walmart. It\u2019ll be delivered to your house. That\u2019s it, man. 1,000 bucks, right? That same gun in Australia on the black market costs $34,000. Now if you have $34,000, you don\u2019t need to be a criminal. You\u2019ve got $34,000. You\u2019re a great little saver. Keep going. So that covers the criminals, but that doesn\u2019t cover the people who wanna murder your family, that are coming after you and your family. It kind of does. The people who do the massacres, it covers them \u2019cause they go\u2026 The kid at Colorado who thought he was The Joker, let\u2019s say that he had some social issues. The kid at Sandy Hook was Asperger\u2019s as fuck. Right? I don\u2019t know if you know a lot about the black market, but you can\u2019t just rock up at the docks going, [Slurring speech] \u201cGuns! Who wants to sell me a gun?\u201d Now, I\u2019m gonna wrap this up. We won\u2019t talk about it anymore. Now\u2026 See, the one thing that I do really agree with with the right to bear arms, I really agree with\u2026 That the real reason it was written was so that you could form a militia to fight against a tyrannical government. In case the government became a bunch of cunts, you could all get your guns and fight back, and that\u2019s why it was written. \u2013 [Audience cheering] \u2013 Yeah! And that made a hell of a lot of sense when it was just muskets. But you do know the government has drones, right? You get that? You\u2019re bringing guns to a drone fight! If we went back to muskets, I\u2019m all for it! Keep the Second Amendment. If we all have muskets\u2026 Muskets are awesome! Every cunt should be carrying a musket with him at all times. You know what\u2019s good about the musket? It gives you a lot of time to calm down. Someone calls your wife fat, and you\u2019re like, \u201cFuck you, buddy! Ah, you\u2019re not a bad guy. You\u2019re all right.\u201d Now\u2026 after the show, we\u2019re gonna go out, have a big party around Boston, see how it goes. I\u2019m not allowed to go to strip clubs anymore. My girlfriend has said that\u2019s a no\u2026 \u2019cause I don\u2019t behave myself in there, so I\u2019m not allowed to go to them anymore. \u2018Cause strip clubs aren\u2019t what women think they are. [Stammers] It used to be like\u2026 Okay, so, when a man goes to a strip club, it\u2019s all about girls being as dirty and as horrible to each other as possible. That\u2019s what men want to see. Women, when they go to their Magic Mike clubs or whatever the fuck they are\u2026 women wanna see a guy, \u201cHey, ladies. He\u2019s a fireman.\u201d And he comes out with his hose and like that\u2026 And whenever a stripper takes their clothes off, they\u2019ve still got the fireman\u2019s hat on or a tool belt on or policeman\u2019s gun on a holster, right? Because even when a man\u2019s naked, a woman wants to know that he has a job. When men watch strippers, we want them to have a job, and that job\u2019s stripping. We want to just look at that girl dancing and have a hand full of money, and just go\u2026 \u201cYou can\u2019t take care of your kids.\u201d It\u2019s\u2026 And when men get private dances in these strip clubs, I don\u2019t know\u2026 I don\u2019t know if women actually know what goes on in those rooms, but basically, it\u2019s dry humping. There\u2019s no dancing. The girl gets in front. She gets where your cock is, pushes it to one side and then she rubs on it\u2026 and then she stands over and puts her cunt right in your face, and you go\u2026 That\u2019s what a private \u201cdance\u201d is, right? I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s private dancing in female strip clubs. [Stammering] I can\u2019t imagine that there would be. I don\u2019t imagine a woman getting out of a back room and going up to her friend and going\u2026 She goes, \u201cHow was it?\u201d And she goes, \u201cWell\u2026 he just sat me down and then he grabbed my genitals\u2026 and then he dragged his scrotum over my forehead. I got to go to the ATM.\u201d So Legit got canceled. [Audience booing] Yeah. I know. I know it. Who would\u2019ve thought it would\u2019ve struggled on that great FXX channel that everyone knew about? The first season is on Netflix. This special is being recorded for Netflix. So you can go watch it there if you\u2019re watching the special. It was\u2026 I\u2019m very proud of it. We had two great seasons of really good television, and if people didn\u2019t\u2026 Now\u2026 The whole TV show is based around one standup routine that I used to do about having a friend with muscular dystrophy that I took to a brothel, which is a true story. And so, when we cast a character with muscular dystrophy who\u2026 In the end, we used DJ Qualls, and DJ Qualls is the skinny white guy out of the movie Road Trip. He\u2019s the skinny white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow, and he\u2019s the white guy out of the movie Hustle & Flow. Now\u2026 the great thing about DJ is\u2026 he already looks disabled. He has that \u201clatter stages of AIDS\u201d thing going on. It\u2019s great for casting. Anyway, but\u2026 I didn\u2019t want DJ to begin with. I wanted a person with muscular dystrophy to make it look authentic, and the Actors\u2019 Union of America said, \u201cYou cannot do that.\u201d Because basically the problem is people with muscular dystrophy, I think, are only allowed to work for two hours a day before they get too tired. And I said, \u201cAll right, what other disabilities and diseases are allowed to work longer?\u201d And they sent me a list. And on this list, I said, \u201cCan you get rid of all the contagious ones? And what have we got left?\u201d So I saw every disabled actor in Hollywood, and I\u2019ll be honest with you, not that many of them. I don\u2019t know why. Maybe they\u2019re just lazy. They don\u2019t wanna work. Maybe they give up on their dreams rather quickly. And none of them were very good, either. Everyone we saw, none of them were very good \u2019cause acting is all about what you do with your hands. None of them knew what to do with their hands, and\u2026 they all came in. Until this one guy came in. I had seen a lot of people that day. This guy was the most disabled person I\u2019d ever seen in my life. He was like\u2026 Think of the most disabled person you\u2019ve seen, then double it. \u2026really super disabled. He was shaped like a pretzel. He was being carried in by this big Russian nurse, carried him in. He made that great disabled sound of\u2026 [Groans] That one. I just loved him. Anyway\u2026 so he comes in for the audition\u2026 and I\u2019m sitting there, and we\u2019re doing the lines together, and at first, I didn\u2019t know if he was mentally all there either, so I was being a little bit patronizing. I was going, \u201cThank you so much for coming in.\u201d And then we did the dialog together, and I didn\u2019t have to worry about a thing. This kid was funny. He was smart. His timing was impeccable. I thought he was just great, and I helped him out of the room, and I come back to the director and I said, \u201cThat\u2019s our guy. That\u2019s who we gotta pick.\u201d And he agreed, but we had to see everyone else who was still in the waiting room. So the next bloke wheels himself in. Now, obviously, he\u2019s just a paraplegic if he\u2019s wheeling himself in, which means the waist down, and that didn\u2019t really suit me because\u2026 paraplegics can get themselves to a hooker without my assistance. But I thought\u2026 \u201cIf he\u2019s a good enough actor, maybe he can quad-up for the role.\u201d So he comes in\u2026 He comes in, I shake his hand, and his leg slightly comes out at the same time. And I went, \u201cWhoa! What\u2019s going on there, kicky?\u201d And he goes\u2026 \u201cOh, you got me! I\u2019m not disabled.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019re fucking what now?\u201d And he goes, \u201cI\u2019m not disabled. I just really wanted the role, so I rented a wheelchair.\u201d And I said, \u201cJust shut up. So let me\u2026 This is how your day has mapped-out thus far. You woke up this morning. You drove to the wheelchair rental place. You rented a wheelchair. You carried it out, I assume. You put it in the trunk of your car. You drove here. You got the wheelchair out. You carried it up three flights of stairs. You went to the waiting room. You put it down next to the severely disabled man and his nurse. Then you sat in it and practiced your lines.\u201d And he went\u2026 \u201cYeah.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking asshole, mate. Get the fuck out of here.\u201d And I kicked him out. And later on that day, I\u2019m sitting there with all the headshots of all the different actors I\u2019m gonna call to tell them they\u2019ve got parts, and I\u2019m holding this disabled guy\u2019s headshot, and I just think, \u201cI\u2019m gonna call this guy up. I\u2019m gonna change his life. This is an awesome moment, right?\u201d And I\u2019m looking at it, and he looks super handsome in his headshot. He looked really like\u2026 And I thought, \u201cThis has gotta be the greatest photographer with the fastest shutter in camera history.\u201d The shutter on his camera has gotta be like\u2026 [Mimicking camera shutter] Like\u2026 [Audience applauding] And then I read the guy\u2019s biography\u2026 and then it dawned on me. \u201cThis guy\u2019s not disabled either! I hated the other fucker for renting a wheelchair! This cunt rented a nurse!\u201d Do you wanna know the level of fucking psychosis you have to go through to rent a fucking nurse? I\u2019m all for a method actor. Get into character three hours before, but once you finish the audition, stand up and go, \u201cTa-da!\u201d And we would have gone, \u201cThat was very good.\u201d But I\u2019ll tell you what you don\u2019t do. Don\u2019t make me carry you to your car! I carried him down three flights of stairs going, \u201cYou did very good.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cThank you, Jim.\u201d [Laughing] [Chuckles] I was, uh\u2026 I go to a therapist\u2026 \u2019cause I get depressed. So I got a therapist every now and again. I literally had one of those moments with my therapist where she was saying words like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna say a word and you say the first thing that comes in your mind.\u201d Like just out of the movies, right? And she went, \u201cRed,\u201d and I went, \u201cBlue.\u201d And then she went, \u201cCooking,\u201d and I went, \u201cFood,\u201d and all that type of stuff. We went like this forever. And then she went\u2026 For the last question, she went, \u201cAnd what\u2019s your favorite thing in the world?\u201d And I went\u2026 \u201cComing on a girl\u2019s face.\u201d Now\u2026 Now, I could\u2019ve said things like\u2026 \u201cIce cream\u201d is a good answer. \u201cHank\u201d would\u2019ve been an excellent answer. But I said, \u201cComing on a girl\u2019s face.\u201d And I\u2019ve had six months to think about my answer, and I stand by it. \u2013 I\u2026 \u2013 [Cheering] I\u2019m not proud of it. I hate myself for thinking it. It\u2019s such a horrible thing to do to another human. When a girl\u2019s on her knees and you\u2026 It\u2019s so\u2026 And as an atheist, I believe in Darwin and all the things that he wrote, but he never had a bit where he explained that. There was never a bit in his book where he went, \u201cWhen a caveman loves a cavewoman, he\u2019ll ejaculate on her face so that flies won\u2019t come near.\u201d There was never that\u2026 never that moment. But, by golly, if it\u2019s not fun. I find it\u2026 To\u2026 Look, to all the girls who take a load on their face from time to time, may I say, \u201cBravo!\u201d Don\u2019t\u2026 don\u2019t think what you do\u2026 has gone unnoticed. We notice. We appreciate your work. I think you deserve a parade of some kind. During Memorial Day, after the Vietnam vets, before the First Gulf War guys, we could bring in, \u201cAnd here\u2019s the women who take a load on their face.\u201d And you could march out, and married men would stand there going, \u201cGod bless you, ladies.\u201d [Audience cheering] I enjoy your acting that you do. The standard tongue out and the\u2026 Like that\u2026 I don\u2019t know why, but I enjoy\u2026 I know it\u2019s a lie. I know you\u2019re not excited, but I still appreciate the effort is what I enjoy. I love the look because it\u2019s such a, \u201cOh, jeez, I\u2019m excited, too. When this come hits my face, there\u2019s a good chance I\u2019ll also orgasm. Anything could happen in this crazy world.\u201d But this is what redeems us as men. This is what redeems us. Just know that the second the come shoots out of our cock and hits your face, our bodies flood with remorse. The next 20 seconds is the nicest we will ever be to you. [Men whooping] I go from being an animal to the sweetest guy on Earth. I\u2019m like, \u201cYou fucking slut\u2026 Oh, I love you. Ah\u2026 Uh, all right. No, no, no. Put your tongue back in. Um\u2026 Keep your eyes shut. Just keep them shut. Uh\u2026 All right, I\u2019m going to get a towel. I\u2019ll get a towel. I\u2019ll get you a towel. All right. You\u2019re a wonderful mother to our child.\u201d [Laughs] [Audience cheering] See\u2026 this is what kills me. My son will one day watch this DVD. And I\u2019m the guy who\u2019s meant to teach him right from wrong, and I\u2019m there wiping come off his mother\u2019s face. I think I did something illegal with my son the other day. I think it might be illegal. Tell me if this is illegal. All right? I\u2019m in the shower. My girlfriend goes off to the gym in the morning, and when she came back, I was in the shower, and Hank ran up, and he started banging on the glass door of the shower like, \u201cArgh!\u201d Like that. And I went\u2026 [Vocalizing] And I saw his little face and I went, \u201cHello, Hankie.\u201d And then in the condensation, I drew a little bowtie on him\u2026 and a little suit\u2026 and then I gave him a voice bubble that said, \u201cI love my daddy. Love, Hank.\u201d But I did it so I could read it. Well, of course he could read the \u201cK,\u201d and\u2026 then I stepped out. I stepped out of the bathroom and I went, \u201cG\u2019day, Hankie!\u201d And he slapped my cock and he ran off. Now, is that illegal? I don\u2019t know. Is it illegal because, A, a child touched my cock, or because, B, I found it really funny and I\u2019ve been telling everyone. And I can\u2019t get angry at him because his whole life, he\u2019s been lying on mats with things dangling over. He\u2019s been training for this his entire life. I think I\u2019ve, uh\u2026 I think I\u2019ve become American, more American than I am Australian lately, and there was a moment where I tipped over where I went, \u201cOh, I think like an American person now.\u201d And I\u2019m happy to do it. I just\u2026 I\u2019ll tell you what happened. I was flying around\u2026 I was doing a tour of Australia, and I was flying domestically around Australia, and I\u2019m so used to airports and stuff here in America that\u2026 Okay, what happens is, when you go\u2026 I was flying Sydney to Melbourne. When you fly domestically in Australia, you go up to the machine, put your name in, prints your ticket out, it prints your bag thing, you put the bag thing on your bag yourself, and then there\u2019s a conveyor belt underneath. You throw your bag on. Bag fucks off. You don\u2019t speak to anyone. Then I go up to the gate bit, and the lady\u2019s going, \u201cTickets, please.\u201d And I\u2019m holding my ID out like a fucking simpleton. \u2018Cause I get through airports quick, man. I\u2019m like, \u201cFucking there you go.\u201d And she went, \u201cPut your ID away. I don\u2019t need to see that.\u201d And I went\u2026 \u201cI think you do.\u201d And she went, \u201cI don\u2019t\u2026 Why would I need to see your ID?\u201d And I said, \u201cI might be a terrorist.\u201d And she went, \u201cWould showing me your ID stop you from blowing the plane up?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019d probably still blow the plane up.\u201d So then I get up to the TSA conveyor belt thing, and I\u2019m so good at the airports. I\u2019m already taking my shoes off as I\u2019m walking, right? And all the Australians behind me assume that I\u2019m American, and they\u2019re losing their fucking shit. They\u2019re like, \u201cOh, for fuck\u2019s sake! One of these cunts, eh?\u201d And the TSA guy goes, \u201cHey, mate, what are you taking your shoes off for?\u201d And I went\u2026 [Shouting] \u201cI don\u2019t know! Maybe they\u2019re bombs?\u201d And he went\u2026 \u201cBut they\u2019re not, are they?\u201d I put me shoes back on. I get my laptop out. Everyone\u2019s going mental. And the TSA guy says, very politely, but extraordinarily sarcastically, he goes, \u201cJeez, mate. That\u2019s a nice computer. Why are you showing it to everyone?\u201d \u201cIt might also be a bomb.\u201d And then the guy said the most Australian thing I\u2019ve ever heard come out of anyone\u2019s mouth ever. He went\u2026 \u201cOh, come on, mate. You wouldn\u2019t have two bombs.\u201d [Audience laughing] [Chuckles] I\u2019m not even quite sure what that means, but it does make some type of sense. All right. Oscar Pistorius. If you haven\u2019t been following the case, you\u2019re missing out. This is the greatest thing since OJ Simpson. You\u2019re fucking missing out, mate. If you don\u2019t know who Oscar Pistorius is, let me fill you in. Oscar Pistorius is a legless man from South Africa, known as the Blade Runner. He ran in two Olympics, the disabled and the able-bodied Olympics in one year. No one has ever done that. He\u2019s an inspiration to hundreds and millions of disabled and able-bodied people alike, and on Valentine\u2019s Day last year, he shot and killed the hottest girl on Earth\u2026 and that\u2019s when he became an inspiration to me\u2026 \u2019cause hot girls have been getting away with too much shit for too fucking long. Let that be a lesson to all you hot girls out there. You can\u2019t just say whatever the fuck you want whenever you fucking want. [Mock tearfully] People have feelings, you cunts. Now, there\u2019s a lot of rumors going around on what happened on that day. One of the theories is that they found in her phone\u2026 He went through her phone, and on her phone, he found some text messages from a South African rugby player on Valentine\u2019s Day, right? Now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been to South Africa, but in South Africa, rugby is more popular than legless running. It goes, rugby, legless running, cricket. Legless running\u2019s their second sport. You wouldn\u2019t have thought that. Anyway\u2026 I\u2019m going to reenact what I believe happened that day. To do that, I will now be doing a South African accent. Now I know, many of you can\u2019t tell the difference between my accent and a South African accent. Here\u2019s the difference. Picture my accent, but I\u2019m punching a black person. What I\u2019m trying to say is South Africans are horrible people. So\u2026 she\u2019s coming out of the shower. She\u2019s been drying her hair. She\u2019s listening to Rodriguez or something. She comes out. He\u2019s laying on the bed. He looks up at her, he\u2019s holding the phone, and he goes, [In South African accent] \u201cWhat the fuck is this? I\u2019ve been through your phone. You have been texting a rugby player.\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201cOh! Fuck you! Who the fuck do you think you are?\u201d \u201cWho am I? I\u2019m Oscar Pistorius, the greatest legless runner that has ever been. That\u2019s who the fuck I am.\u201d \u201cWell, I would rather be with a rugby player. At least he is a whole man, not a three-quarter man like you.\u201d \u2013 [Audience exclaiming] \u2013 I know. [Audience laughing] \u201cOh! Fuck you!\u201d \u201cNo! Fuck you! I\u2019m leaving you!\u201d And then she storms out of the room, and then he was like\u2026 \u201cYou fucking bitch! [Grunts] I hate you! [Grunting] You will rue the day\u2026 that you left Oscar Pistorius, the Blade Runner! Don\u2019t go anywhere! [Grunting] I hate you!\u201d That\u2019s where he keeps his legs. All right. Then he put the blades on. \u201cOh, you\u2019re in trouble, missy. I tell you. I go to my gun safe.\u201d She locked herself in the bathroom. He shot her through the bathroom door. Seems like overkill, doesn\u2019t it? Bathrooms only have little tiny locks on them, but Oscar\u2019s one of the few men on Earth that couldn\u2019t kick the door in, right? He was wearing the blades, so\u2026 Boing! Ah! So\u2026 I think Oscar will probably go to prison. Now\u2026 in South Africa, one in four people have AIDS. I assume it may even be worse in the prison population. Now, can I say this? Look\u2026 I\u2019ve never raped a man. I hate that I have to put \u201ca man\u201d in that sentence, but whatever. I\u2019ve never raped a man, but\u2026 if I was going to rape a man, it would be a legless Olympian\u2026 \u2019cause in prison, it\u2019s all about getting one up on other people, and making people think you\u2019re tough and all that. Like, \u201cYou want to fucking rape me? I just raped an Olympian, bitch. Is that what you fucking want?\u201d There\u2019d be a wonderful moment\u2026 when you\u2019re in the showers and he was crawling away like the end of a Terminator movie. [Chuckling] You know what I like about that joke? So often when you tell a joke, the rapist is the villain in the story, but not in that one. Not in that one. He\u2019s the hero. All right, we have to get going soon. Before I leave, \u2013 I thank you very much for coming. \u2013 [Audience groaning] No, I said, \u201csoon,\u201d not \u201cover.\u201d It\u2019s just soon, you cunts, so calm down. [Chuckles] [Man whistles] I always\u2026 I always find that weird when someone, like, whistles like that. What do they think is going to happen? Like, I\u2019m going to go, \u201cFucking you know me, mate. I was enjoying claps and cheers, but what I needed was a high-pitched squeal noise. Thank God you came along to pick up my spirits.\u201d [Man] Love you! All right, final story. Now, I was in South Africa again. Jeez, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be working in South Africa after this special comes out. I used to do, like, one tour in South Africa every year, and I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be invited this time. They\u2019ll be like, [In South African accent] \u201cWe don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s no good.\u201d Anyway, so, I\u2019m in South Africa, and I had to fly back from Cape Town to Los Angeles, which is, like, a 26-hour flight. You\u2019ve to go up to London and go across. Cunt of a trip. Um\u2026 But it was all right \u2019cause I had a business class ticket, so I didn\u2019t give a fuck. And when I travel economy, I try to dress up nice \u2019cause I like to look good in case someone recognizes me and I might get an upgrade. But when I\u2019ve already got a business class ticket, I try to look like a bag of shit\u2026 \u2019cause it\u2019s important to me that everyone else in business class doesn\u2019t want me there and they\u2019re annoyed by my presence. So\u2026 I\u2019m wearing a white T-shirt that\u2019s got brown stains on it with a hole in the side. I\u2019m wearing these small shorts with just one testicle hanging out. So, anyway, I go up to the counter, up to the business thing with the thing, and I go, \u201cHello,\u201d and the lady goes, [In South African accent] \u201cOh, Mr. Jefferies, I\u2019m so sorry, but you have been downgraded.\u201d I said, \u201cYou what now?\u201d She goes, \u201cBusiness class is full. You have been downgraded.\u201d And I said, \u201cI understand that business class is full. I bought one of the tickets that made it full.\u201d And she went, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir. There\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d And then I just went, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d Now, you know when you\u2019re dealing with customer service people, and they want you to swear, \u2019cause as soon as you swear, they don\u2019t have to engage with you anymore. They can act like they\u2019re the first adult never to hear a swear word, and they can get really offended, right? So I went, \u201cAre you fucking kidding me?\u201d And she went, \u201cPlease do not speak to me that way! I have done nothing wrong!\u201d And I said, \u201cAre you, a white South African, telling me you\u2019ve done nothing wrong?\u201d Anyway\u2026 tensions rose. The manager comes over. Big fat cunt called Simon Fulcher, right? He walks over and goes, [In South African accent] \u201cWhat is wrong here? What is wrong?\u201d And I said, \u201cI bought a business class ticket and I want a business class ticket.\u201d And he goes, \u201cWhat do you want me to do? Make a new chair for you? There are no more seats. I can\u2019t do anything.\u201d He goes, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what I can do. Go up to the executive lounge. Have some peanuts. Enjoy a beverage. Listen to Rodriguez, and if something opens up, we will move you back up to business class. So I thought, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I can do.\u201d So I walk off with my ticket. I\u2019m walking through the airport like, \u201cFucking British Airways, bunch of fucking cunts.\u201d Right? I get up to the counter. And the woman behind the counter said, \u201cTickets, please.\u201d And I hand over my ticket and she goes, [In South African accent] \u201cI\u2019m sorry, sir, but this is for business class passengers only. Your ticket says \u2018economy\u2019 on it.\u201d And I said\u2026 [Inhales sharply] \u201cI bought a business class ticket, but you people have downgraded\u2026\u201d And as I was doing my little speech, she looked past me and went, \u201cNext.\u201d [Audience exclaiming] \u201cListen here, you fucking cunt.\u201d [Audience laughing] All right? Now, you say \u201ccunt\u201d in any foreign country, people lose their fucking shit. Security came from everywhere. I was going, \u201cDon\u2019t you fucking come near me, cunt!\u201d And I said, \u201cI want to speak to Simon Fulcher,\u201d like I\u2019m\u2026 And they go, \u201cAll right.\u201d They ring the manager up, and then they go\u2026 He goes, \u201cIs it the pale Australian man?\u201d And the guy went, \u201cYes.\u201d He goes, \u201cWe\u2019ve had problems with him. Let him through.\u201d Right? So I go through. I\u2019m sitting there, I\u2019m eating my peanuts. And I\u2019m just angry now, going, \u201cFucking British Airways. Fucking cunts, fucking\u2026\u201d Like that. And in walks in a group of Americans, about 30 of them. You know the type, right? They all\u2026 And whenever I see Americans abroad\u2026 I\u2019ll do my impersonation of any American abroad. When Americans are abroad, you\u2019re just pointing out shit you see. You\u2019re just walking around going, [In American accent] \u201cOh, this is great! Look at that. That\u2019s a chair right there. Okay. Oh, what\u2019s that over there? Okay. Wonderful. Great.\u201d Right? And this group walked in, and one of the women in the group went like this, she went, [In American accent] \u201cDid anyone else see that Australian guy speaking to that lady out there? Some people have no class.\u201d And I put my head around the pylon, and I went, \u201cYou can fuck off and all! You don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve been through! I\u2019ve been downgraded!\u201d And as I said that, 18 other people who were given the same lie that I was given, that they were going to be the next people promoted up to business class, the penny dropped. None of us are getting promoted. They all lied to us, and we formed an angry militia in seconds. It was like a scene out of Braveheart, and they all stood up and went, \u201cFucking downgraded!\u201d And the woman in the group was doing this, \u201cDon\u2019t speak to me that way. Who the hell do you think you are?\u201d And all the men in the group were like, \u201cHey, why don\u2019t you shut the fuck up? Just shut the fuck up.\u201d \u266a It doesn\u2019t matter These people seem very angry, so \u266a And a guy breaks from the group and he tries to calm everyone down. And, sometimes, Americans, sometimes, you can seem a little insincere. And he came up and he went, [In American accent] \u201cHey. Hey. Yeah, I get it. [Exhales sharply] Downgraded, yeah. That really grinds my gears, I tell you that. Yeah, I would write a strongly-worded letter. I really would.\u201d And then I thought, at least this guy\u2019s being nice, and I said, \u201cLook, mate, don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s your fault.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy are you in such a big group anyway?\u201d And he goes, \u201cOh, we\u2019re in Neil Diamond\u2019s band. That\u2019s Neil Diamond\u2019s backup singer you just called a cunt there.\u201d And as he said that, Neil Diamond walked around the corner like a fucking superhero\u2026 and I reacted like he was one. I went, \u201cNeil Diamond!\u201d And Neil Diamond went, [In husky voice] \u201cHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d And then, for a second there, there was a bit of my brain that thought maybe Neil Diamond could solve problems. And I went, \u201cNeil! Me and all these people, we\u2019ve been downgraded!\u201d And Neil went, \u201cOh! Oh, right. Uh, well, maybe that\u2019s our fault. We decided to come back a day early.\u201d \u201cYou can fuck off and all, Neil Diamond!\u201d And then a fight breaks out amongst the Neil Diamond band and the downgraded. Punches are thrown. Not by me. I don\u2019t know if you have the Internet, but I\u2019m not much of a fighter. I\u2019m an excellent scurrier-awayer. I get down. \u201cHey, what have you got there? Hiya!\u201d Anyway, the airport police came. Three people were arrested from the downgraded\u2026 but three people were arrested from the Neil Diamond band, and that meant that three seats opened up in business class. [Audience cheering] Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. Good night. Appreciate it. [Audience cheering] [Upbeat music playing] Thank you. Go home. Let\u2019s have a drink. Bye.","joe":"[rock music playing] [audience cheering] [announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Joe Rogan. [audience cheering and applauding] What the fuck is going on, San Francisco? Thanks for coming. I appreciate it! God damn! Put your phone down, fuckface! I see you, bitch! Put your phone down! Motherfuckers. They can\u2019t use their eyes. Everybody\u2019s gotta live through their goddamn phone. Whoo! I\u2019m high as fuck. Whoo. It\u2019s strange. I wasn\u2019t sure if I was gonna do this sober. I\u2019m like, \u201cUgh\u2026\u201d It\u2019s not the move. Not in San Francisco. This is\u2026 I love pot, but the people that are making edibles need to slow the fuck down. Oh, my God! What are you trying to do to people? I had a pot gummy bear the other day. I think we can all agree a gummy bear shouldn\u2019t be able to steal your soul. Right? How the fuck are these people making these things, man? They\u2019re not consistent. That\u2019s also part of the problem. You don\u2019t know what you\u2019re getting, \u2019cause they\u2019re not making them the same place where they make Tylenol. Nah, it\u2019s some greasy dude with a Grateful Dead T-shirt on and a gray ponytail. He\u2019s got a bowl of ingredients, and he can\u2019t remember whether or not he put weed in yet. This dude\u2019s time traveling, just back and forth. He just keeps chucking weed in there until it looks like lawn trimmings. You eat it, and it\u2019s not what you\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s not regulated. You gotta ask questions. I asked a dude at the pot store. I go, \u201cHey, man, how strong are the gummy bears?\u201d He goes\u2026 That\u2019s not a unit of measurement. He\u2019s like, \u201cEl diablo. El diablo.\u201d \u201cFuck, man. How much should I take?\u201d \u201cJust the leg.\u201d \u201cJust the leg? Why are you selling whole bears? What the fuck are you trying to prove, man?\u201d They just watch you leave with that bear. They go, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d They know. They know you\u2019re not gonna die. You\u2019re gonna think you\u2019re gonna die, but everybody lives. Learn some shit. We learn some shit from the scary trips. See, the thing about edibles, one of the problems with it being illegal, is that a lot of us don\u2019t have a lot of information that we could use. Like, there\u2019s a difference between smoking it and eating it. When you smoke it, you get THC. But when you eat it, it\u2019s processed by your liver, and it produces something called 11-hydroxy metabolite that\u2019s five times more psychoactive than THC. And it lets you talk to dolphins. [audience laughs] This is a real moment that changed my life. I was in Hawaii, and we were on a boat, and we were fishing. We were pulling these lines behind the boat, and I was so high, I was trying to figure out which way the Earth was spinning. Like, the boat\u2019s going this way, and the sun\u2019s up there. I\u2019m like, \u201cUm\u2026\u201d For like 20 minutes, I\u2019m paralyzed. So, while this is all happening, these dolphins just show up. And if you\u2019ve ever been around wild dolphins, they\u2019re very trippy. It\u2019s very different than you expect, because they look at you. They, like, check you out. They, like, pop out of the water and they, like, look at you\u2026 like a person, not like a fucking deer or woodchuck. They look at you like another person. Granted, I was so high I thought I was gonna die, but\u2026 I\u2019m making eye contact with these dolphins, and I started thinking, \u201cHow smart are these fucking things?\u201d Because we\u2019re fishing. Dolphins eat fish. But you never catch dolphins. Ever. No one has ever gone fishing and accidentally caught a dolphin. And all I could think of while these dolphins were, like, hopping through the water, and looking at us and shit\u2026 I was thinking, \u201cIf people lived in the water, you\u2019d fucking catch \u2019em all day.\u201d They wouldn\u2019t even have to live in the water. If cheeseburgers just floated down Geary Street\u2026 at least once a week, a guy would be like, \u201cI\u2019m taking a chance.\u201d And you see \u2019em getting yanked up to the clouds. \u201cFuck! We lost Billy!\u201d The bottom of his sneakers in a puff of cloud. You don\u2019t catch dolphins on fishhooks, man. That\u2019s weird. They\u2019re around fishing all the time and like, \u201cBitch.\u201d They\u2019re fucking smart. How smart? Well, I watched a dolphin documentary, and it said they have a cerebral cortex that\u2019s 40% larger than a human being\u2019s. I don\u2019t know what that means, but if you say it right and don\u2019t fuck up the words, it makes you sound smarter than you really are. I think what it means is they have big fucking brains. But we don\u2019t think of them as being smart \u2019cause they don\u2019t do what we do. Right? They don\u2019t send e-mails. They don\u2019t have houses. But if you lived in their world, you don\u2019t need anything. You don\u2019t need your fingers. No one\u2019s typing. They have a language that\u2019s so complex, we can\u2019t understand it. All the food\u2019s free. They stay where the water\u2019s warm. I started thinking, \u201cHow fucking smart are they? What if they\u2019re exactly the same as us? What if it\u2019s just some different branch of evolution? We went one way. They went the other. What if consciousness is the same?\u201d I was thinking, \u201cWhat if me to me is the same as me to a dolphin?\u201d The way you think of yourself when you say the word \u201cme.\u201d I was like, \u201cWhat if that\u2019s exactly how a dolphin feels? They\u2019re just living life through different biology, different genetics, different life experiences. But if I lived a dolphin\u2019s life, I would be him. And if he lived my life, he would be me.\u201d And then I started thinking, \u201cWhat if that\u2019s the case with people? What if everyone is exactly the same? We\u2019re just living life through different bodies. What if that\u2019s the secret of happiness? Treat everyone as if it\u2019s you living another life.\u201d [audience cheering and applauding] I mean\u2026 And then I thought, \u201cGod damn, how good is this weed I\u2019m getting in California? Whoo! I\u2019m on a fucking floating craft out in the middle of the ocean, talking to water people.\u201d The problem with treating everybody as if it\u2019s you living another life is you wanna fucking smack yourself. Half the people you meet, you just wanna fucking smack \u2019em. We live in the weirdest time ever. I mean, it\u2019s the most awesome time ever. But it\u2019s the weirdest time ever, too. We\u2019re, like, that close to President Trump. \u2013 [man 2] No. Boo! \u2013 \u201cNo. Boo!\u201d You boo, but you won\u2019t vote, you fucks! All those Bernie Sanders people, \u201cYo, Bernie\u2019s the shit.\u201d \u201cDid you vote for him?\u201d \u201cVoting ain\u2019t real, bro. It doesn\u2019t even work, dude.\u201d We are that close to President Trump. Bill Cosby\u2019s a rapist, and Bruce Jenner\u2019s a chick. We\u2019re in an episode of Lost. Down is up and up is down! This is the type of world you get when you give kids participation trophies for getting their ass kicked in soccer games. This is the world we get! We get a goddamn Nerfed-up world filled with nonsense. Nobody wants to be president. Nobody. I hope Hillary wins. That way we can realize chicks can\u2019t do that fucking job either. It\u2019s a stupid job. It\u2019s a stupid job invented back when people used to write with feathers. It\u2019s dumb! It\u2019s just some old-school shit that we need to get rid of. It doesn\u2019t make any sense. Being president is great if there\u2019s like 50 people. If there\u2019s 50 people, you can figure out which one\u2019s the best. Three hundred million people? I have three kids. I don\u2019t know where the fuck they are right now. How is this one dude in charge of 300 million people? It\u2019s nonsense. It\u2019s so old and stupid. They make this guy sleep in this fucking White House. If Trump wins, you know his house is cooler than the White House. He\u2019s like, \u201cI\u2019m not sleeping in that shitty-ass, stupid house.\u201d Trump\u2019s probably got, like, a tube at home that he opens up, and a Chinese girl just pops out of it, and sucks his dick and goes right back in. That\u2019s what I would do if I had that kind of money. We\u2019re down to assholes! Where\u2019s Elon Musk when you need him? Where\u2019s the fucking geniuses? Where\u2019s Mark Cuban? No. We got an old lady trying to get back at her husband for a blowjob he got in the \u201990s. We got an old man who hates money. And we got a reality TV star with a plastic set of hair. You can\u2019t have a president with environmental concerns, when every time this motherfucker does his hair, we lose a foot of ozone layer and a polar bear bursts into flames. He\u2019s got, like, a closet full of Aqua Net at home. You can\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t give a fuck when you have that thing going on, dude. Stop that. The White House got broken into while Obama was in office. The first time in over 100 years that someone broke into the White House. Also, the first time a girl was guarding the front door by herself. \u201cWhat are you trying to say, that women can\u2019t do everything men can do?\u201d Exactly. That\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. That seems sexist, right? People say, \u201cYou\u2019re sexist.\u201d No, it\u2019s not sexist. Here\u2019s why it\u2019s not sexist. \u2018Cause men can\u2019t even do everything men can do. See? There\u2019s no physical equality, folks. That\u2019s why we have the Olympics. \u2018Cause there\u2019s people that can do some shit that you and I can\u2019t do. One of those things is guarding the fucking White House. I know I can\u2019t guard the White House. You know how I know? Because I\u2019ve met Shaquille O\u2019Neal and his dick is where my face is. That\u2019s not equality. That\u2019s not white privilege. Listen, if the White House is experiencing a Shaq Attack, I\u2019m the wrong dude to save the world. I did Fear Factor with Shaq. If we\u2019re holding hands, it\u2019d be like a six-year-old at the park with his dad. We\u2019re barely the same thing. So, do I think women should guard the White House? No. I don\u2019t think I should, either. It\u2019s not sexist to say that women can\u2019t do big physical labor things as good as giant men can. But people will tell you it is. Well, I\u2019m not sexist. As a matter of fact, my favorite people are all female. I have a wife and I have three daughters. They\u2019re my favorite people in the world. But I could beat the fuck out of all of them. Okay? Listen\u2026 If they\u2019re guarding the door, I\u2019m getting in. I don\u2019t mean to sound cocky. But I\u2019m just real confident. I could fuck them up if I had the flu. Okay? Yeah, we\u2019re different. We\u2019re different. I could beat up my cat, too. I\u2019m not proud of it. I just tell you what\u2019s up. If you wanna bet money, bet money on me. I\u2019ll fuck that cat up. Most likely. Cats are fucking weird like that, man. I was petting my cat once and he bit me. I was like, \u201cWhoa! Are we gonna do this? What the fuck are you doing here?\u201d I got a little nervous. Got a little nervous. \u201cWomen can do everything men can do. This guy\u2019s a piece of shit. We\u2019re leaving. Too much information is going in that I don\u2019t agree with!\u201d \u201cWhat the guy said was total bullshit. Total bullshit.\u201d How\u2019d that girl get that job? I\u2019ll tell you how that girl got that job. Because someone let her have that job. Which means, either there were a bunch of guys that were trying to fuck her\u2026 or her boss was a chick and she hated her. Either one\u2019s possible. Look, if there was a bunch of guys that were trying to fuck her, that makes total sense. If there\u2019s one hot girl and she\u2019s working with five guys in an office, no work\u2019s getting done in that office. That office is now just an audition to see which guy gets to fuck her. Each one of those guys will just slowly start to morph to figure out what this girl likes. Men become like an octopus that tries to fit its way through a keyhole. \u201cThere\u2019s gotta be a fucking way. There\u2019s gotta be a fucking way!\u201d You got this girl who\u2019s like, \u201cI could guard the front door.\u201d \u201cOh, you could definitely guard the door. No doubt. No doubt.\u201d And over time, if this woman doesn\u2019t sleep with one of these men and claim him, over time, these guys will just start morphing. And they\u2019ll just start saying ridiculous, preposterous shit. \u201cDebbie wants to guard the front door. Do you have a problem with that?\u201d \u201cNo, I don\u2019t. As a matter of fact, I think women are amazing. Plus, I\u2019m vegan.\u201d And they will just\u2026 They will wear patchouli. They will do what the fuck they have to do. Next thing you know, poor fucking Debbie at the front door\u2026 \u201cWhy am I alone?\u201d [chuckles] The whole story is so bananas. And it\u2019s one of my favorite stories. So I\u2019m gonna give you the whole story of the break-in at the White House with no edits and no comic exaggerations. This is the real story. \u2018Cause a lot of people think there\u2019s some grand conspiracy. There\u2019s some cabal of evil geniuses that\u2019s pulling the strings on everyone in America. It\u2019s most likely that people are just dumb as fuck, in all sorts of walks of life. This is the story. This is the real story about the person who broke into the White House. First of all, people are always worried, \u201cThe government\u2019s checking out my e-mails, bro. The government\u2019s watching us all the time.\u201d They pulled this guy over two months before he broke into the White House. He had four handguns, two rifles and a machete with him. They didn\u2019t even watch him. He had a map. On the map was Washington, and it had an \u201cX\u201d where the White House is. They\u2019re like, \u201cYou\u2019re good to go.\u201d They let him go! Two months later, this motherfucker broke into the White House. And why did he break into the White House? Why do you break into the White House ever? Because you want to die. You don\u2019t\u2026 That\u2019s like a suicide run. That\u2019s the only reason why someone runs toward the White House. If you had to ask someone, \u201cWhat kind of security do you think they have at the White House?\u201d \u201cOh, dude\u2026 they got snipers on every corner. They got lasers in the grass. If you get too far, they open up a door, you drop right into jail.\u201d Nope. Turns out they don\u2019t even have a dog. You just fucking run. The guy who made it into the White House, he had 800 rounds of ammunition in his car. Left that there. Took a knife. That\u2019s a guy who wants to die! He\u2019s just sitting in his fucking car going, \u201cFuck the government! Fuck my ex-wife! And fuck everybody! I\u2019m gonna do this! Fuck you!\u201d Just sprinting, \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m doing it! Oh, my God, I\u2019m doing it!\u201d Thinking, with every step, \u201cThis is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this is gonna be the last step of my life. No, this\u2026\u201d And he gets to the front door. It\u2019s unlocked! He opens it. There\u2019s a girl there by herself. Smacks her to the ground and just starts running through the hall. Ah! He\u2019s probably going, \u201cWhy am I alive?\u201d He\u2019s probably thinking\u2026 He was inside for minutes. For minutes, running around. He got tackled by an off-duty officer. He was probably thinking, \u201cI wanted to die. I don\u2019t want to go to fucking jail. Will somebody please shoot me?\u201d Then he was probably pissed. \u201cWhere are my tax dollars going? What kind of security are you fucking people running in this place?\u201d [chuckles]\nImagine when Obama found out a girl was guarding him. He was probably like, \u201cEverybody, everybody, not that much diversity. I mean, what, are you playing fucking fairy tale games here?\u201d Obama\u2019s got a hard job, \u2019cause he\u2019s the first president that\u2019s ever been around while Google was here. You know, he could Google his own name if he gets crazy in the middle of the night. Right? \u201cSo, let me see what the people have to say.\u201d He\u2019d just go, \u201cObama is a\u2026\u201d [groans] \u201cI\u2019m none of those fucking things.\u201d Freakin\u2019 out. Shit. [sighs] Probably thinking, \u201cWhy the fuck did I do this?\u201d I think the guy who broke into the White House and Obama probably have a lot in common. In that\u2026 they went for it, but they probably never really thought they were getting in there. You can\u2019t quit once you\u2019re the president. The moment Obama actually got into office, like, \u201cGood morning, Mr. President,\u201d he was probably like, \u201cOh, no! What the fuck did I do this for? I didn\u2019t think I was actually gonna get in. [sighs] I can\u2019t sleep. I\u2019m freaking out. Everybody wants to kill me. [exhales heavily] Who the fuck is guarding me?\u201d Looks out in the hallway. There\u2019s a girl taking selfies. That\u2019d be the greatest selfie of all time. A girl with her ass out, duck lips, in the background, a dude\u2019s breaking into the White House. [laughs] You know I\u2019m not making this up. You\u2019ve all seen this. This is recognizable. Pigeon-toed is a good move \u2019cause you can\u2019t get away that good. You just, like\u2026 Like there\u2019s something wrong with your back. That\u2019s a recognizable pose. When did that start? \u2018Cause if you look at the original pictures back when people first invented pictures, everybody just stood there looking hungry. Like, if you saw a photo from the 1800s, and in the background a girl was going\u2026 She\u2019s a fucking time traveler! Nobody knew that move back then. Somebody had to see their face. \u201cOh, people like that. They like what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Combo. A two-hole combo attractor. It\u2019s all over online! It gets you a lot of likes. I saw a gal on Instagram, she has eight million followers. All she does is take pictures of her ass. That\u2019s it. She\u2019s got a winning formula. She sticks with it. No witty memes. There\u2019s no inspirational quotes. Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh. Just a lot of this. Different ways. And she\u2019s just a regular girl, man. I\u2019m watching this, I\u2019m like, \u201cThis is a different kind of person.\u201d She has eight million people that have no idea what her voice sounds like. She doesn\u2019t have a job that they like. She doesn\u2019t have an occupation that they follow. They\u2019re just staring at her ass. This is a new kind of human. There\u2019s never been a person, psychologically, that\u2019s had to navigate those kind of waters. If you really stop and think about it, science should really step in and start looking at this. Don\u2019t go to South America to study some new frog that nobody gives a fuck about. There\u2019s a girl in Florida with eight million people staring at her ass. How does this girl keep a relationship? What is her day like? How many dick pics does she get sent? How many dick pics does that girl receive on a daily basis? Is it like the national debt counter was just fucking spinning out of control constantly? I bet if she turns on the notifications, her phone just starts screaming and runs away from her. I bet if she deletes all the dick pics from her phone, it would be physically lighter. This is a new kind of person. We really have to understand, there\u2019s never been a person like this before. And she\u2019s just a person. Like, that kind of influence, that kind of attractant, that\u2019s a very strong drug to have in the hands of just a girl. And as a guy who has daughters, I just think of that, like, that\u2019s kind of fucking\u2026 That\u2019s weird. Because this girl has eight million people staring at her ass. Eight million creeps and weirdos and perverts objectifying her. I mean, I follow her, but I\u2019m not like those other assholes. I\u2019m different. I care. I care about who she is. I\u2019m a nice person. I\u2019m a hero or something. [laughs] \u201cI\u2019m different. Those other guys are assholes. Men are noble. Men are noble and true.\u201d Mmm. If we get to come. If men don\u2019t get to come, we get real Sm\u00e9agol-like real quick. Just a few months of no dates, [imitating Gollum] \u201cMesus is just so disappointed with all the mens mesus meets. Mesus is so embarrassed at how other mens talks to you. Mmm. Oh.\u201d Everyone wants to set themselves up as being the noble one. Everybody wants to be Matthew McConaughey, to save the world on a rocket ship. There\u2019s people that are signing up to go to Mars. Do you know about this? There\u2019s a mission to Mars, a manned mission to Mars, where 200,000 people have signed up to be amongst the four people to die on Mars. They\u2019re gonna take a one-way trip to Mars. That\u2019s some sad shit for a bunch of reasons. First of all, it\u2019s some sad shit, \u2019cause that\u2019s 200,000 people that don\u2019t have any real friends. Right? If it\u2019s someone you love, your real friend\u2026 If one of my friends is gonna move to Florida, I\u2019ll be like, \u201cBitch, where the fuck are you going? You\u2019re gonna go to Florida? We can\u2019t hang out if you go to Florida. Why the fuck are you moving to Florida, man?\u201d But you might be able to deal with it. \u201cWe can just visit each other every now and then.\u201d But if your friend was gonna move to Mars, you\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, really? Get in the fucking car! Just get in the car, dude.\u201d Take him out to Death Valley, \u201cLook around! Sucks, right? Mars sucks worse. Get back in the car, stupid.\u201d Jesus Christ! There\u2019s places in America you can\u2019t live, man. You don\u2019t wanna live in Detroit, why the fuck are you talking about moving to Mars? People really consider moving to Mars. It\u2019s one of the dumbest ideas ever. But if you say that, people will eco-bro you. Have you ever been eco-broed? These people will find an opportunity to virtue signal over you, as Michael Shermer likes to point out. Like, puff their chest out and say that they\u2019re probably better than you. \u201cHey, dude. Seriously? You think there\u2019s something wrong with going to Mars? Well, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve paid attention, man. We maybe should colonize Mars \u2019cause California\u2019s almost out of water.\u201d Then he\u2019ll nod, like, \u201cYeah, bitch.\u201d We\u2019re right next to the ocean. What the fuck are you talking about? Look at all that water. You fly over it, it takes a day. The world\u2019s blue. It\u2019s more water than it is not water. We have a salt problem. We don\u2019t have a water problem. Suck the salt out of the water, we got a goddamn party. Instead of pissing and moaning\u2026 \u201cToo complicated, bro. We gotta go to Neptune.\u201d Oh, my God! You\u2019re fucking crazy. We\u2019re a crazy race filled with crazy people. We\u2019re like a dude with a dirty house. Like, \u201cMan, I gotta build a new house.\u201d No, you gotta stop shitting in your kitchen. Stop piling up newspapers you\u2019re never gonna read in front of your bathroom, you fuck! We\u2019re crazy! One-way trip to Mars. A one-way trip in coach with three other people so fucking stupid, they\u2019re willing to die on Mars with you. Great. What great conversation you\u2019re gonna have. It\u2019s nonsense, folks. My friend was like, \u201cThey\u2019re not gonna die on Mars, man. If people are smart enough to figure out how to get to Mars, they\u2019re smart enough to figure out how to get back.\u201d Here\u2019s why that doesn\u2019t make any sense. People smart enough to get to Mars aren\u2019t going. See, that\u2019s the dirty secret about rocket travel, ladies and gentlemen. Nobody smart enough to make a rocket ever gets in one of those fucking things. No. No, they look at each other right before the launch and they go\u2026 They talk German and they get behind giant fucking concrete bunkers. They take some square-jawed, corn-fed dude from the middle of the country, tuck a Bible under that dude\u2019s arm and strap him into that giant metal dick, and shoot it off into the heavens. That\u2019s what we do. And that is what that is. That is a metal dick. It\u2019s a robot dick, and we\u2019re trying to fuck the sky. We are literally trying to come people out of the tip of a metal dick onto other planets. Our ultimate goal is that we get those planets pregnant, and they\u2019re too filled up with people, and then they gotta make a new metal dick. \u201cBro, we gotta go to Jupiter.\u201d Then they make another one. They shoot that fucking thing, and they fill Jupiter up. We just keep filling the cosmos up with people. And we never evolve. And we never change. We stay perfect, like we are right now. Who\u2019s in? You\u2019re gonna all come with me. We\u2019re gonna leave here right now and go to the Church of Scientology right down the street, and it\u2019s all gonna make sense when you find out that you are an eternal being that created reality so that you can enjoy it. I watched that HBO documentary a couple too many times. I went Clear, I think. I think I\u2019m Clear. I\u2019m back! I\u2019m back now. If you haven\u2019t seen\u2026 [chuckles] I had to watch Going Clear, a Scientology documentary, \u2019cause I have a neighbor who\u2019s a Scientologist, and I don\u2019t even think he\u2019s gay. I don\u2019t know what the fuck\u2019s going on. [exhales heavily] But he sleeps really close to me, you know. Like, my bed\u2019s here, this fucking dude\u2019s bed\u2019s, like, over there. His house is\u2026 I mean, if you take away the walls, he\u2019s fucking right there. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat does this crazy fuck believe?\u201d And Scientology is a wonderful religion. Not just because it was written by a science fiction author who wrote more fake shit than anyone that\u2019s ever walked the face of the Earth. And not by a small amount. This dude never made a second draft in his fucking life. Everything was one draft of nonsense. And he wrote more of it than anybody. Not in his neighborhood, not in his state, not in a year, not in a decade. More than anyone that\u2019s ever lived, ever. And Scientology is still like, \u201cI don\u2019t see any red flags. I think we\u2019re good. I think this is legit as fuck.\u201d If Scientology is a good religion, it\u2019s because other religions get to make fun of \u2019em. It\u2019s like it\u2019s the one religion that even the Mormons are like, \u201cBitch, you believe what? Hold on. I mean, at least we don\u2019t have video of Joseph Smith. There\u2019s some fucking shitty black and white footage of L. Ron Hubbard with a captain\u2019s outfit on. You wanna explain that? [chuckles] Why does he have all those awards on? Why is Tom Cruise wearing a gold medal the size of a dinner plate? What the fuck is going on with you people?\u201d I watched it with my mom, and it was like\u2026 First of all, Scientology, they don\u2019t pay taxes. That\u2019s disturbing. They\u2019re tax-free, which means they\u2019re a recognized religion by the government of the United States. Which means the government of the United States had to go over what they believe and went, \u201cEverything seems in order. None of this shit seems like a cult.\u201d Well, what the fuck is a cult, and what\u2019s a religion? So I had to look it up. Turns out\u2026 I don\u2019t know who wrote this, but it\u2019s a perfect definition. A cult is bullshit. It\u2019s created by one person. That person knows it\u2019s bullshit. In a religion, that dude\u2019s dead. So it\u2019s a religion \u2019cause L. Ron Hubbard\u2019s dead. So I guess they got it on a loophole. I watched it with my mom, and my mom was like, \u201cI can\u2019t believe anybody would fall for that.\u201d \u201cYou made me go to Catholic school. The fuck are you talking about? There was a child molester dressed like a sorcerer sitting on a golden throne, and you made me call him Father. Slow your roll, lady.\u201d Imagine if I talked to my mom like that. Oh, my God. Jokes, folks. Just jokes. I don\u2019t have a problem with people being religious because I just think life itself is too open-ended. It\u2019s too confusing. And I think we\u2019re evolving. And part of our struggle in evolving is unanswered questions. We wanna seek these answers. But in the meanwhile, they just give you so much anxiety, and it fucks with you so much. There\u2019s nothing wrong with joining a cult. I think you gotta just join a nice, friendly one. Like, the Mormons are a good cult. Here\u2019s why. They don\u2019t get mad at anybody. Like, they never kill anybody. Like, here\u2019s a perfect example. Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the guys who created South Park, they made a hilarious musical called The Book of Mormon. It\u2019s fantastic. If you haven\u2019t seen it, it\u2019s so fucking hilarious. But it\u2019s also brutal! Brutal about the Mormons. You know what the Mormons did? They went to see it, and they took out a full-page ad in the playbill. It said, \u201cIf you enjoyed this musical and you wanna find out more about being a Mormon, please visit our website.\u201d They just took it right on the chin like champs. They didn\u2019t get mad. They didn\u2019t get defensive. They didn\u2019t kill anybody. That\u2019s a good cult. They just said, \u201cWhat do you wanna do?\u201d \u201cWe got nine wives. Shut the fuck up!\u201d \u201cEverybody just\u2026 Everybody, just chill. Just chill.\u201d That\u2019s a good religion. That\u2019s a good cult. Some cults aren\u2019t that good. They get fucking testy. You know the one. We don\u2019t have to say who. You know what I\u2019m talking about. There\u2019s that one that will kill you if you draw their guy. \u201cCome on, man. I can\u2019t even draw your dude? What if I draw a dude drawing your dude?\u201d \u201cNo loopholes!\u201d \u201cFuckin\u2019 relax, bro.\u201d And this isn\u2019t just theoretical. People have died \u2019cause they made cartoons. Before the most recent Paris attacks, there was a magazine called Charlie Hebdo, and they were attacked, where 11 cartoonists were killed. Eleven more were wounded, and they killed a cop, too. Fucking crazy! Over cartoons! And when you\u2026 When there\u2019s radical, crazy people in the world, what\u2019s interesting is the reaction to radical, crazy people and how everything just sort of kind of balances itself out when things get weird.\nBecause when these people got killed over a cartoon, the whole world was in shock. The whole world was outraged. But one of the scariest things about it was nobody wanted to print those pictures. You couldn\u2019t see \u2019em in the LA Times. You couldn\u2019t find them in Time magazine. You had to go online and find them. It was a dark moment for free speech, because everybody\u2019s like, \u201cOh. I don\u2019t wanna get killed. I don\u2019t wanna show the pictures.\u201d It was weird, until\u2026 the balance. Because after they got killed and nobody wanted to print the pictures, word got back to Texas\u2026 where they promptly held a \u201cDraw Muhammad\u201d contest in Garland, Texas. I\u2019m not making a word of this up. You can Google it, and I\u2019ll wait. They had a \u201cDraw Muhammad\u201d contest in Garland, Texas. Two dudes showed up, started shooting at the building. They were killed almost instantly. Why? Because they were at a \u201cDraw Muhammad\u201d contest in Texas. How obvious does a trap have to be before you start getting suspicious? What, are you livin\u2019 in a Wile E. Coyote cartoon, motherfucker? You ever go to Texas? That\u2019s not Santa Monica, bitch. That\u2019s a totally different kind of white people. Those are some Wild West people that have computers and modern guns. They\u2019re not supposed to be there. People didn\u2019t evolve in Texas. It\u2019s not like they were monkeys, then they became people and they stayed in that spot. No. No, they landed on boats on the East Coast. The stubborn ones stayed. The smart ones made it to California. But along the way, we lost a bunch of people. [audience laughs] And some of them just stuck around. \u201cY\u2019all go ahead. We\u2019re gonna hang back here. I\u2019m gonna draw the biggest dick the world\u2019s ever seen in the sand. My wife\u2019s got the biggest titties. I\u2019mma try to fuck a snake. I think it can be done.\u201d They just stayed. They just gathered cattle, stockpiled ammo. And they all talk alike. And that\u2019s why you gotta be nervous. You gotta be nervous in places with accents, okay? It\u2019s one of the reasons why I can prove that California is the best spot to live. \u2018Cause all the spots that suck, they all have to sound like each other. \u2018Cause I grew up in a place like that. I grew up in Boston. It\u2019s not that the people in Boston suck, but the weather sucks. It\u2019s fucking horrible. And in the winter everybody gets in their car in the morning, and just goes, \u201cFuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck!\u201d And everybody\u2019s worried about\u2026 It\u2019s a real possibility you might starve to death one day. You might freeze trying to walk home. [imitates Boston accent] So they all talk in the same way. \u201cOh, my God. How many more months till summer? Ahhh! When is this fucking winter gonna be over? We need more firewood.\u201d [whines] They have to sound like the people around them. So if other people invade, like, \u201cWe stick together. We\u2019re all in this together.\u201d That\u2019s how they are in Texas, too. They\u2019re like, \u201cY\u2019all ain\u2019t from around here, are ya?\u201d They have a fucking certain way of talking. Which is proof positive why California is the best spot. Try making fun of a California accent. What are you gonna do? Speak clear and concise? What are you gonna do? You gonna mock us? You\u2019re gonna say some shit that everybody understands? They\u2019re not supposed to be in Texas, folks. It\u2019s not even a state. It\u2019s a republic. They were like, \u201cMan, we ain\u2019t so sure about this whole United States thing. We\u2019re gonna hang back. Hang back, see how this plays out.\u201d They don\u2019t have any rules. They have like three pages of rule books. Here\u2019s how I know this. I\u2019m gonna tell you a fact, a fact about Texas that will change the way you think about Texas. There are more tigers in captivity in Texas, in private collections, than there are in all of the wild of the world. I\u2019m gonna repeat it because I know you\u2019re like, \u201cOh, the Fear Factor guy is just making shit up to make his jokes work.\u201d No. There\u2019s more tigers in dudes\u2019 yards in Texas than the rest of the fucking planet! How is that possible? Because they can. Because they went through the rule book\u2026 [mumbles] \u201cIt don\u2019t say shit about tigers. Order it up, dude. Order it up, dude!\u201d One guy got a tiger, and his neighbor\u2019s like, \u201cShit, I didn\u2019t know we could get tigers.\u201d And he got two tigers. And the first guy was like, \u201cI ain\u2019t about to let this faggot out-tiger me.\u201d And he opened up Tiger World with his oil money. We\u2019re gonna need those people, folks, if the Russians invade. We can\u2019t make fucking warrior babies with those chicks in Marin County with fake asses and rubber lips, okay? We\u2019re gonna need some real warrior genes. We\u2019re gonna need some women who wear non-ironic Daisy Dukes. They got cowboy boots with no socks and stinky feet. And they yell out, \u201cChris Kyle, rest in peace,\u201d when you make \u2019em come. We need those women! If the Russians come, we gotta be ready. Think about the children. Think about the children while I get a sip. This is super important, ladies and gentlemen. A lot of people are sleeping on\u2026 [laughs] Imagine if I had real points. Oh, Jesus Christ. [audience cheering] I love you fuckers, too, man. So excited to be here. [sighs] I have kids and I lie to them. I get high around \u2019em, too. People say you shouldn\u2019t do that, but they don\u2019t see it. They say you shouldn\u2019t be intoxicated around your children. Well, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m high. I call it \u201celevated.\u201d It\u2019s a different thing. The people who have a problem with that, they don\u2019t understand what getting high is. Like, they think you\u2019re gonna be to your kid, like, \u201cWho are you?\u201d What do you think? What\u2019s the worst thing that can happen if I\u2019m a little high around my kid? They\u2019re gonna get extra hugs, and daddy\u2019s going to be paranoid about objects. \u201cLook out. Don\u2019t go there.\u201d That\u2019s it. Plus, I have cool conversations. I have a six-year-old daughter, man. There\u2019s not a lot of 48-year-old man and 6-year-old girl have in common, other than the fact she\u2019s my daughter. And so, our conversations are normally pretty boring. But when I\u2019m high, I\u2019m like, \u201cYou know, you call that thing your baby, your doll. You call it your baby, but you know it\u2019s not a baby, right?\u201d \u201cYeah, I know it\u2019s not a baby.\u201d \u201cDo you call it a baby because you\u2019re the youngest and you like having someone who is responsible for you?\u201d \u201cMaybe.\u201d \u201cOkay. That\u2019s cool. That\u2019s cool. Give me a hug. I love you.\u201d [kisses] It\u2019s weird, man. It\u2019s weird raising little people. There\u2019s some things that I didn\u2019t expect. One of the things I didn\u2019t expect is you have to lie to them. Like, you don\u2019t have to lie to them about a lot of things, but you have to lie to them about Santa Claus. It\u2019s just one of those things, man, \u2019cause it\u2019s like a community. You have to think about what your kid\u2019s gonna tell other kids. Because when it comes to Santa Claus, you don\u2019t want your kid to be one of two things. You don\u2019t want your kid to be the first kid that tells everyone that Santa Claus is bullshit, \u2019cause that kid\u2019s an asshole. But you don\u2019t want your kid to be the last kid that figures out that Santa Claus is bullshit, \u2019cause that kid\u2019s a moron. So you got\u2026 You got a little bit of\u2026 You\u2019re like, \u201cOh, no. When do we do this? When do we do this?\u201d And no one knows when to do it. You just let the kids figure it out. Then they\u2019re like, \u201cDad, what the fuck?\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cAw\u2026 Oh, I missed the boat. I missed the boat.\u201d Nobody knows when to do it. Nobody can be honest about it. They have little meetings and shit. And I\u2019m like, \u201cWhen do we tell \u2019em?\u201d This lady goes, \u201cWhen they\u2019re 11.\u201d They\u2019re gonna be fucking by then. I told her it was funny. She didn\u2019t believe me. I\u2019m like, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m off by a year.\u201d That\u2019s not as funny, but it\u2019s\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean it. But it\u2019s this thing. They want to keep the kids in the dark. And they wanna pretend they\u2019re the only one that\u2019s teaching the kid. This is a weird thing that people do. They\u2019re like, \u201cI teach my kids, man. I teach my kids.\u201d \u201cEh\u2026 when you see \u2019em.\u201d But unless you\u2019re some freak who homeschools your children in the forest, your kid\u2019s gonna go to school. They\u2019re gonna go to school, and they\u2019re gonna be in a class with 50 other kids. The teacher only makes 20 bucks a year, and she\u2019s thinking about dick. That\u2019s all she\u2019s thinking about. She\u2019s thinking about getting stuffed. She\u2019s a young, fertile woman who loves kids. And she\u2019s writing on that chalkboard. And the kids all huddle up and share information. Like, \u201cYeah, what did your dad tell you? Your dad tell you that, yeah? My dad says Santa Claus is fucking bullshit, okay? You ever go near a chimney? It\u2019s that big. What the fuck? Teacher\u2019s coming. Play with blocks. Act stupid. Uh, how does this work?\u201d They play dumb. They play dumb! They\u2019re like little prisoners, trying to figure their way out. They make little papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 heads and pretend they\u2019re napping. They\u2019re little humans. They wanna run shit. \u201cWho is these people telling us what to do? Are they being straight with us, man? What the fuck is going on?\u201d I knew the day my daughter knew that Santa Claus is bullshit. She came home, stared me down. She was, like, mad-dogging me. She took her book bag, and just goes\u2026 [scoffs] Walked right up to the chimney, looking at me. \u201cHow the fuck?\u201d \u201cDad, have you ever met Santa Claus?\u201d \u201cNo, honey, I\u2019ve never met him.\u201d \u201cBut you let him in the house?\u201d And there\u2019s this moment\u2026 It was a moment where a seven-year-old has you at checkmate. You\u2019re like, \u201cOh, shit.\u201d I don\u2019t know whether to high-five her or to keep lying. You wanna go, \u201cYeah, you got me. You got me. You got me. That\u2019s bullshit. No, the big bang is real, but this is bullshit.\u201d The big bang sounds even less real. The problem is, you have to be consistent. If you\u2019re teaching your kids nonsense, you gotta teach \u2019em only nonsense. You can\u2019t mix nonsense in with, like, real stuff. Like, my daughter will go like, \u201cHow do birds fly?\u201d I go, \u201cBirds have bones that are hollow, so they\u2019re really light. Then they have feathers, which cover a large surface area. And they use the hollow bones and the feathers to push down on the air. See, the air looks like it\u2019s nothing, right? But it\u2019s actually a bunch of gases. That\u2019s why the trees move when the wind blows. The birds can manipulate that and go through 3-D space.\u201d \u201cWhoa!\u201d \u201cYeah, nature is crazy.\u201d \u201cYeah. How does the fat man get through the little hole?\u201d \u201cMagic! Christmas magic! Now go to bed. I\u2019m trying to fuck your mom! Go to bed!\u201d [audience laughing] Jokes, folks. Just jokes. Can\u2019t talk like that. That\u2019s how you make strippers. You gotta be nice. They\u2019re little, tiny people. They\u2019re adorable. They don\u2019t know anything yet. You gotta teach \u2019em everything. You can\u2019t talk mean. [inhales sharply] Kids are a lot like really fucking stupid people\u2026 in that if you get ten really stupid people in a room, the most confident one just starts running shit. They don\u2019t have to have any more information, they just have to be more confident. If you get a bunch of dummies together, they\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d \u201cI fucking do. I fucking do.\u201d The guy doesn\u2019t have to have any extra data, he just has to be the only one that\u2019s confident. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s like in school. My daughter\u2019s class has this fucking kid named Debbie. And every day it\u2019s, \u201cDebbie says\u2026\u201d Oh, fucking Debbie says. Debbie says what? You don\u2019t think about that before you have kids. Not only are you gonna have kids, but your kids are gonna make friends, and then you have to make friends with the fucking parents of your kids. And some of \u2019em are crazy. My daughter\u2019s like, \u201cDebbie says Adam and Eve are the only two people in the world, and all people came from them. Is that true?\u201d [sighs] And this is weird. Like, you don\u2019t know what to do, right? You want to be diplomatic. You don\u2019t want to cause problems at school. But you gotta be honest. And one of the most difficult things to say to a kid is, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cSweetie, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know if Adam and Eve is where people came from. But nobody knows, because no one from today is alive back then. So it\u2019s not something you can measure. So it\u2019s not something you can see. So we don\u2019t know. But here\u2019s what we do know. You know how some people have big ears and some people have little ears?\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWell, some people have brains that are made out of dog shit. And they get horny, too. And what happens is, they have to find someone even dumber than them to have sex with. It\u2019s like the opposite of evolution. And then they have a kid, and their kid is fucked. Their kid is fucked! And everybody wants to pretend it\u2019s a level playing field. There\u2019s no level, anywhere you look. Is an eagle and a salmon level? Does the salmon ever get to eat the eagle? No. The universe does not want even! It wants conflict and resolution and constant improvement. Okay? I\u2019m gonna shut this light out, and I\u2019m gonna go fuck your mom right in the mouth. All right?\u201d I don\u2019t say these things. I don\u2019t say any of these things! I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe Debbie\u2019s right. Doesn\u2019t make sense to me. How would that work?\u201d \u201cHow would that work?\u201d \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t work, would it?\u201d Adam and Eve are the only two people. They have kids. And then, where do all the other people come from? I guess the kids just start fucking each other. Is that what happens? Mom fucks the kids, or the\u2026 Yeah, exactly. Debbie\u2019s parents. They were at my house, man, for a cookout, and the dude told me the Earth\u2019s 10,000 years old. They\u2019re Young Earth Christians. They\u2019re sweet people, by the way. Before I shit on them\u2026 I\u2019m gonna shit on them, but before I shit on them, they\u2019re sweet. They\u2019re really nice people. I hug \u2019em every time I see \u2019em. They\u2019re really kind, nice people. But they just found a part of their brain, they\u2019re like, \u201cI have no use for this.\u201d [grunts] Chucked that whole logic, discerning-reason part. \u201cThis fucking thing\u2019s confusing.\u201d They\u2019re Young Earth Christians, which means they follow the strictest interpretation of the Bible possible. I\u2019m like, \u201cHow many people believe the Earth is less than 10,000 years old?\u201d Uh! I looked it up. There\u2019s a recent Gallup poll that said that 46% of America believes the Earth is less than 10,000 years old. [audience booing] Here\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t be scared. They can only measure people dumb enough to answer polls. And when you factor that in, you\u2019re talking about a really small number. \u2018Cause you know what the average response is if you call people up and say, \u201cHow old\u2019s the Earth?\u201d Number one answer is, \u201cOlder than your mother\u2019s pussy.\u201d And then they hang up. Number two answer is, \u201cFuck you!\u201d After that, you start throwing numbers around. And only 46% of those dummies were stupid enough to think the Earth is 10,000 years old. That\u2019s Debbie\u2019s fucking parents. So out of the people that answer polls\u2026 Is it even 1%? It might be 1%. Only 46% are that fucking stupid. And that\u2019s the 1% we should really be worried about. We\u2019re worried about the wrong 1%. Not that we shouldn\u2019t be worried about the really rich, greedy people. We definitely should. We should definitely worry about bankers and people who\u2026 They\u2019re just stockpiling resources. They could help the world in some really impossible ways for anybody else. But they don\u2019t. They\u2019d rather just pile up their gold. [grunts] Yeah, that 1% is awful. But there\u2019s another 1% that freaks me the fuck out that no one\u2019s talking about. That\u2019s the 1% who leave comments on YouTube videos. Who the fuck are those freaks? Could you imagine people talking to each other like that in real life and not beating the shit out of each other? I mean, if Jesus Christ himself came back from the dead and had a YouTube page, the first comment would be, \u201cYou ain\u2019t shit without your dad, pussy.\u201d These are monsters. This is not a normal person\u2019s response. Normal people don\u2019t leave comments. What a normal person does, they watch a video. They like it or they don\u2019t like it. That\u2019s it. It ends right there. But what you\u2019re dealing with is the process of racism, and child abuse, and neglect and shitty genes. And the Insane Clown Posse is playing. They know all the words, and they\u2019re wafting up their farts, and their Cheez Doodle fingers. And like, \u201cAn open letter to Jennifer Lopez\u2026 Let me pause and just jerk off in my shirt real quick, here. [mimics fart] Ugh\u2026 Dear, Jennifer, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s about time you dress a little more classy? What are your children gonna see when they see\u2026\u201d Just fucking think of the meanest, most biting shit that\u2019s gonna cut it. As if Jennifer Lopez has time in between eating diamonds and fucking all her background dancers in a castle that she built with her ass. But you know, \u201cLet me check the YouTube comments to see if my self-esteem\u2019s on point. Oh!\u201d And you know who\u2019s dumber than them? Me. \u2018Cause I read their shit and I get mad. I know they\u2019re stupid. I still get upset. Fuck! This is the world, folks. This is the world we\u2019re living in. Are we happy? I\u2019m not sure. \u2013 Is this what we wanted? I don\u2019t know. \u2013 [woman] No! \u2013 No. \u2013 [woman] No! \u2013 Are you sure? \u2013 [woman] No! Why are you doing this? What is this? What are you doing? Are you fighting for freedom? \u2013 What\u2019s happening? \u2013 [woman 2] No! Are you White Panthers? What is this? [man] Life sucks! \u2013 What are you saying? \u2013 [man] Life can kind of suck sometimes. Life can kind of suck? Maybe it\u2019s how you\u2019re livin\u2019 it, bitch. \u201cLife can kind of suck.\u201d It\u2019s the greatest time ever to be alive. \u201cYeah, I\u2019d live in the old days when you could die from crabs.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get any better than today, man. So stupid. \u201cMake America great again.\u201d It\u2019s as good as it\u2019s ever been. What the fuck are you saying? We have 4G everywhere. When has it been better? We have Netflix. When has it been better? Come on, man. Stop. It\u2019s never been better. This is as good as it\u2019s ever been. It\u2019s just weird. It\u2019s just weird. You gotta get your shit together, bitch. Don\u2019t blame the world. God damn it. Damn it, man. And listen, if you\u2019ve seen any of this show, and you said, \u201cI think some of the stuff you\u2019re saying is really funny, but I sense a lot of, like, macho posturing from you. I sense a lot of, like, bullshit, tough-guy stuff.\u201d You\u2019re totally correct. And what it is is I live with all women, okay? And I\u2019m becoming more of a bitch every day of my life. And I just wanna say I\u2019m not unhappy. I\u2019ve never been more happy in my life. This is the happiest I\u2019ve ever been. But when you\u2019re with all girls, like, you have all girls all the time, you have to make little compromises. You don\u2019t think about it while it\u2019s happening. It\u2019s like the rock doesn\u2019t think about the water carving a path through it, but eventually, that fucking path is gonna get deep. And when you\u2019re with all people that are different than you, they just go, \u201cHmm\u2026\u201d They just start looking at you like little raptors testing the fence. [squawks] They\u2019ll just start poking at you. It\u2019s what people do. It\u2019s natural. It\u2019s just what people do. If you live with people that all are on AT&T and you\u2019re on Verizon, they\u2019re like, \u201cDude, look at my bars. Make the switch. Come on over. What are you, a fucking Democrat, dude? Libertarian is where it\u2019s at. Wake up! Join us!\u201d When you\u2019re with all girls, they just start\u2026 They constantly fuck with my manhood. It\u2019s like, I\u2019ll come home and some new thing is painted pink. I\u2019m like, \u201cWhy is this pink?\u201d \u201cIt looks better pink, Daddy.\u201d \u201cIt looks better pink, Daddy.\u201d And my wife\u2019s like, \u201cI think they\u2019re right.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cOh\u2026 I see what the fuck is going on here. It\u2019s mutiny!\u201d They just chip, chip, chip away. It\u2019s like if my manhood was a mountain of marbles. Every day they steal two. They just walk up to my stack\u2026 You can\u2019t say shit. You can\u2019t say shit, \u2019cause it\u2019s only two marbles, and you\u2019re like, \u201cI still got all these marbles. Everything is gonna be okay. I\u2019ll deal with this eventually.\u201d But you\u2019re not gonna deal with it. Every day, two more marbles. You never get those marbles back. You see it comin\u2019. You don\u2019t do anything about it. You\u2019re like, \u201cI gotta go to sleep. All right, everybody stop crying. I gotta go to sleep.\u201d And men don\u2019t want to admit that. \u201cNot me, bro. Not me, bro. I\u2019d rather just live in the woods by myself.\u201d What are you, a fucking Coldplay song? Huh? What are you, a character in a book, you piece of shit? No one\u2019s honest. No one\u2019s honest about how much we need other people. That\u2019s why the characters that we adore so much in the movies are the people that don\u2019t need people. The people who just walk away from it all, like, \u201cWow, what a rebel!\u201d But in real life, we need people so bad that the worst shit you can do to a prisoner is put them in solitary confinement. So think about that. You\u2019re in a cement box filled with rapists and murderers. And the worst shit they can do is leave you alone. We\u2019re fucking weird. We are weird, \u2019cause what we are really is we\u2019re some weird superorganism that, like, needs each other in some sort of strange way. But we\u2019re all in denial. \u201cI\u2019m kind of a loner.\u201d Oh, shut the fuck up. There\u2019s no such thing. It\u2019s not real. Every person in this room, me included, all of us, we are all a calculation. We\u2019re all an ongoing, on-running calculation of all the interactions you\u2019ve ever had with all the people that you\u2019ve ever met. And you do a bunch of things that people like, and start doing more of that. You\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019ll do more of that.\u201d You find things that people don\u2019t like, you\u2019re like, \u201cI\u2019ll keep that shit to myself, hmm. I don\u2019t like that feeling. Hmm.\u201d That\u2019s what we do. That\u2019s what we do. It\u2019s weird. We don\u2019t want to admit it. But that\u2019s who we all are. And I\u2019m just telling you this because I\u2019ve never been more of a bitch. Right now, I have slowly but surely bent until I\u2019m in this position. This is how I\u2019m riding out my days, just like this. \u201cOkay, okay, okay, okay.\u201d But I\u2019m also telling you right now that I\u2019m not going out like Bruce Jenner. Oh! That\u2019s right, politically correct San Francisco. Here\u2019s my take on this Bruce Jenner thing. And, you know, everybody has their own\u2026 Not really. This is what everybody\u2019s take is. This is the take that you\u2019re supposed to have. \u201cHe\u2019s always been a woman trapped in a man\u2019s body.\u201d Maybe. Definitely maybe. Definitely people are like that. Definitely, there are people who were born in the wrong gender. And am I saying they should stay their gender? No. Who gives a fuck? You should do whatever you wanna do. You should be happy. You should be free. I don\u2019t care what you do. But\u2026 it\u2019s also possible that, maybe, if you live with crazy bitches long enough, you become one. That\u2019s all I\u2019m saying. I don\u2019t see this discussed. It is entirely possible. If you put a praying mantis on a leaf, it becomes the color of the leaf. Why? Because it wants to live. It wants to survive. It wants to be accepted by its environment. You show me a man who\u2019s lived with the Kardashians for ten years who didn\u2019t come out a chick, and then we\u2019ll have some data, okay? \u2018Cause right now, we lost a fucking American Olympian, and I want you to have some respect! We\u2019re down Bruce Jenner. And I\u2019ve got a close eye on Kanye West, and I don\u2019t exactly like what I\u2019m seeing. [audience applauding and cheering] Look at Kanye West. He\u2019s a very talented, young, heterosexual man who starts a clothing line\u2026 he\u2019s clearly jealous about Taylor Swift, and he tweets like a coked-up stripper in the middle of the night. You don\u2019t see what I\u2019m seeing? We are watching the plot of a fucking Stephen King book play out! An American athletic hero moves in with a woman who\u2019s made hundreds of millions of dollars through no way anyone can explain to anyone. He breaks up with her. She turns him into a chick. The whole world tells him he\u2019s beautiful. You tell me you don\u2019t see what I\u2019m seeing? You have to say\u2026 You have to say she\u2019s beautiful. \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d She\u2019s not beautiful, and neither am I. Look, I look like a thumb with two thumbs. Okay? You put me in a dress, I\u2019d be even more disgusting. \u201cBeauty\u2019s unusual.\u201d There\u2019s a lot of cool shit that isn\u2019t beautiful. Sixty-year-old dudes in skirts are on that list. Jesus fucking Christ! What kind of games are we playing here? Why are you lying to children? That\u2019s beautiful. What are my kids gonna think when they see a mountain or a rose? \u201cIs that beautiful too, Daddy? Explain.\u201d Ahhh! Bang! I can\u2019t! The world\u2019s gone fucking bananas! \u201cWhat you\u2019re saying is horribly transphobic and incredibly regressive. You should be embarrassed at what you\u2019re doing. You\u2019re doing this just to get laughs at someone else\u2019s expense.\u201d Maybe! Or maybe Bruce Jenner lived with demons. Maybe they waited by the bed\u2026 until they knew he was in heavy REM sleep\u2026 so they could assume their true form. [squawking] Climb up and kick off their designer shoes to reveal black raven\u2019s claws. Clutched the edge of the bed and just\u2026 whispered in his ear. [snarls] [imitating demon] \u201cBruce\u2026 [breathing heavily] we would like you better if you were one of us.\u201d \u201c[groaning] I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t be one of you. I was\u2026 I was born a man.\u201d \u201cNonsense! [snarling] [hissing] Nonsense. Bruce\u2026 you no longer can be held prisoner by the gender of your birth. You\u2019re free. Bruce\u2026 [snarling] your lips are too thin\u2026 for the cover of Vanity Fair.\u201d \u201cHuh? What? Wait. Wait. Did you say the cover? Okay. Are you fucking with me? Because\u2026 you know the cover\u2019s always been my dream.\u201d \u201cIt can be real! [snarls] It can be real. All dreams\u2026 can be real through surgery. Sleep.\u201d [audience cheering and applauding] Thank you very much, San Francisco! I had a great fucking time with you savages! Let\u2019s take a selfie. Shit. We got it. Putting together one of these fucking specials is stressful as shit. I appreciate the fuck out of all you people being here tonight. And I love you guys. Thank you very much! [cheering and applauding continues] [rock music playing]","john":"All right, Petunia. Wish me luck out there. You will die on August 7th, 2037. That\u2019s pretty good. All right. Hello. Hello, Chicago. Nice to see you again. Thank you. That was very nice. Thank you. Look, now, you\u2019re a wonderful crowd, but I need you to keep your energy up the entire show, okay? Because\u2026 No, no, no. Thank you. Some crowds\u2026 some crowds, they have big energy in the beginning and then they run out of places to go. So\u2026 I don\u2019t judge those crowds, by the way, okay? We\u2019ve all gone too big too fast and then run out of room. We\u2019ve all made a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d sign\u2026 Wait. You get that poster board up, and you\u2019re like, \u201cI don\u2019t need to trace it. I know how big letters should be. To begin with, a big-ass \u2018H\u2019. Followed by a big-ass \u2018A\u2019 and\u2026 Oh, no! Oh, God! Okay, all right. Real skinny \u2018P\u2019 with a high hump, and then we\u2019ll put the second \u2018P\u2019 below the hump of that first \u2018P\u2019, sort of like a motorcycle sidecar situation. And now I have no room for the \u2018Y\u2019, so I\u2019ll do a kind of curled-up noodle \u2018Y\u2019. Block letters and cursive look good together.\u201d And then you go to write \u201cBirthday\u201d and you totally forget the lesson you just learned with \u201cHappy.\u201d You\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, but the past is the past. Big-ass \u2018B\u2019. Surely more letters will fit in the same space.\u201d You\u2019re very friendly here in Chicago. I mean, we\u2019re all violent here, but you\u2019re very friendly. No, really. And I don\u2019t like confrontation, \u2019cause I\u2019ve never been in a fight before. Though, maybe you could tell that from the first moment I walked out on stage. I don\u2019t give off that vibe. Some people give off a vibe of\u2026 Right away, they\u2019re like, \u201cDo not fuck with me.\u201d My vibe is more like, \u201cHey, you could pour soup in my lap and I\u2019ll probably apologize to you.\u201d When I walk, for real, my feet go out like this. I\u2019m so open and vulnerable. I look like a doll that you point out molestation on. \u201cShow us on this white comedian where the man touched you.\u201d It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been home to Chicago. I got married since then. Thank you. I married my wife. I love saying \u201cmy wife.\u201d It sounds so adult. \u201cThat\u2019s my wife.\u201d It\u2019s great, you sound like a person. I said it even before we were married. We were just dating, and we were once getting on an airplane, and Anna\u2019s ticket didn\u2019t say anything and my ticket said \u201cpriority access.\u201d It doesn\u2019t matter why. But we were getting on and I said, \u201cUh, can my wife board with me?\u201d And they were like, \u201cYes, of course. Right this way.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, that is so much better than all those times I was like, \u2018Can my girlfriend come?'\u201d And, yeah, I shouldn\u2019t have said it that way, but still. \u201cMy wife\u201d just has some kick-ass to it, you know? \u201cGet away from my wife! No one talk to my wife!\u201d Marriage is gonna be very magical. \u201cI didn\u2019t kill my wife!\u201d That\u2019s like, \u201cOoh, who\u2019s that fella? I bet he did kill his wife.\u201d Being married is so nice. I never knew relationships were supposed to make you feel better about yourself. That\u2019s not really a joke, that\u2019s just a little sweet thing I like to say. \u2018Cause I\u2019d been in relationships where I got cheated on, like, long ones. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a long relationship where you got cheated on, but it changes your whole worldview. \u2018Cause when I was a kid, I used to watch America\u2019s Most Wanted. You know how kids do. And I would always think to myself, \u201cHow could another person kill someone? How could a human being kill another human being?\u201d And then I got cheated on, and I was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not gonna do it, but I totally get it.\u201d And I don\u2019t mean in that way of, like, \u201cNo one else can have you.\u201d I don\u2019t care about that. It\u2019s just creepy to have an ex out there after things have ended badly. They have a lot of information. Anyone who\u2019s seen my dick and met my parents needs to die. I can\u2019t have them roaming around. I talked to a lot of people before I got engaged, you know. And I heard this expression about whether or not you should get married. This is an old expression. People say this. They say, \u201cWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\u201d You ever heard that before? It\u2019s a bananas insulting expression\u2026 to an entire gender. But also, it makes no sense. \u201cWhy buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?\u201d You\u2019re not allowed to milk a cow that you don\u2019t own. That\u2019s not even a situation. Was that a problem at one point? Like, in the dairy community? Was that happening a hundred years ago in some village? Some Dutch prick was sneaking in at night being like, \u201cAh-ha-ha, I take your milk.\u201d And the farmer was like, \u201cWell, then, this is your cow now.\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo, no proof of purchase.\u201d And he ran off into the night. That sounded Dutch, right? You know what that\u2026 you know what that expression means? It means, \u201cWhy would you marry a woman if she\u2019s already having sex with you?\u201d Which has nothing to do with what relationships are even like anymore. Now, it\u2019s like, \u201cWhy buy the cow?\u201d Uh, maybe because, every day, the cow asks you when you\u2019re gonna buy it. And\u2026 \u2026 you live in a really small apartment with the cow, so you can\u2019t avoid that question at all. And also, the cow is way better at arguing than you are. And the cow grew up in a family that knows how to argue. \u201cWhy buy the cow?\u201d Uh, maybe because every time another cow gets bought, you have to go to the sale and you have to sit next to your cow at the sale, and your cow looks over at you the entire time like\u2026 And does not enjoy the sale at all\u2026 even though she\u2019s the one that wanted to go to the sale. And she\u2019s especially mad because that farmer and cow met, like, eight months after you guys met. \u201cWhy buy the cow?\u201d Well, let\u2019s be real here. You\u2019re very lucky to have the cow that you do have. \u201cRoping in cows and getting milk out of them was never anything you were known for, John.\u201d By the most liberal of estimates, there have been about eight cows total, several unmilked, and\u2026 a lot of people think that you like bulls, and if you just bought\u2026 They assume it. When you search your name, the third thing to come up is like, \u201cJohn Mulaney bull?\u201d And if you just bought the cow, nobody would say that anymore. They\u2019ll still say it. \u2018Cause there are those guys who, they buy a cow, and then on the side, total matador, but\u2026 But, for real, Chicago, why buy the cow? Let\u2019s be real. Why buy the cow? Because you love her. You really do. And, yeah, yeah\u2026 Sure, she\u2019s a bossy little Jew, but\u2026 \u2026 she takes care of you. And you don\u2019t wanna be some old man stumbling around, like, \u201cHey, you seen any loose milk?\u201d My wife is Jewish. She\u2019s a New York Jew. I did it! Now, I was raised Catholic. I don\u2019t know if you can tell that from the everything about me. My wife is Jewish, I grew up Catholic, so we got married by a friend. Being married by a friend is a beautiful ceremony that alienates both families\u2019 religions, while confusing the elderly people at the wedding. \u201cWhat\u2019s the name of the bishop?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s actually stand-up comedian Dan Levy. He was the host of MTV\u2019s Your Face or Mine?\u201d I saw a lot of Catholic weddings, though, because I was an altar boy\u2026 And a hush falls over the room. Isn\u2019t it weird how that became a scandalous thing? That was just some boring shit I had to do on weekends. But now, it\u2019s like saying, \u201cI was a French maid for a period of time. I was treated well in my day. I worked for a variety of sirs.\u201d No, being an altar boy was just a boring gig, you know? You\u2019d serve Mass and then you\u2019d serve weddings sometimes. My brother was once an altar boy at a wedding, and he was standing there with another altar boy in this big, packed church in Chicago where we grew up. And the bride was coming down the aisle, and the organ was playing, and all the pews were filled, and the bride got all the way to the altar, and the groom lifted the veil off of the bride, and right at that moment the other altar boy said, \u201cAw, she\u2019s ugly.\u201d And then they looked, and they were right next to the video camera. And I know that\u2019s awful, but wouldn\u2019t you give a million dollars to see that wedding video? It was the best moment of this stupid woman\u2019s life, and she\u2019s walking down the aisle, and the organ\u2019s like\u2026 And she gets all the way to the altar to her betrothed, and he unveils her to the world and to the eyes of God. And right at that second, for no reason at all, some Cheeto-fingered, rat-mustached, 13-year-old prick decides to go, \u201cAw, she\u2019s ugly!\u201d Hopefully the videographer knew some sound editing so he could fix it to be like, \u201cAw, she\u2019s beautiful. She\u2019s enchanting.\u201d I grew up Catholic. I don\u2019t go to church anymore. But I went on Christmas Eve with my parents, \u2019cause you know how you lie to your parents. So\u2026 we go into the church and I was like, \u201cI got this under control.\u201d And then I got schooled because they introduced a bunch of new shit. No, I was going through Mass and I was batting, like, .400. And then in the middle of Mass, the priest said, \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d And everyone said, \u201cAnd with your spirit.\u201d And I was the one pre-Y2K asshole going, \u201cAnd also with you. What? Huh? What? Huh? What? When? When?\u201d For those of you that aren\u2019t Catholic, I don\u2019t mean to exclude you, even though we love to exclude you, but\u2026 There\u2019s a part in church where the priest says, \u201cPeace be with you.\u201d And for many, many years, we all said\u2026 \u2013 \u201cAnd also with you.\u201d \u2013 Very good. But they changed it to \u201cAnd with your spirit.\u201d Because that\u2019s what needed revamping in the Catholic Church. That was the squeaky wheel that needed the grease. In Rome, they were like, \u201cLet\u2019s see. What problems can we solve? Problem one. No.\u201d I\u2019m actually glad they changed that, though. I never liked \u201cAnd also with you.\u201d I always found that clunky. \u201cAnd also with you.\u201d That\u2019s not how you talk. \u2013 \u201cHave a nice day.\u201d \u2013 \u201cAnd also you having one.\u201d It\u2019s just a little bit wrong, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s just a little off. Like, when someone\u2019s like, \u201cHow are you?\u201d And you\u2019re like, \u201cNothing much.\u201d And it sort of makes sense. Never begin a sentence with \u201cAnd also.\u201d You just immediately sound caught off-guard. It sounds like if at the first church ever, like, they weren\u2019t expecting it. Like, the priest was like, \u201cHey, this is the first time we\u2019ve ever had church. I just wanna say, \u2018Peace be with you.'\u201d And they were like\u2026 \u201cWhat? Oh. Uh, yeah. And also you should have some.\u201d \u201cHey, that\u2019s good. Let\u2019s keep that for 2,000 years. And then change it to trick John.\u201d My wife and I don\u2019t have any children, we have a dog. We have a little puppy named Petunia. She\u2019s a tiny little French bulldog puppy. I like having a puppy that\u2019s a bulldog, \u2019cause it\u2019s like having a baby that is also a grandma. Her body is young, her face is as old as time. She definitely saw the Nazis march into Paris. She always gives me this look of like, \u201cOh, the things I have seen, you cocksucker. You have no idea. The Gestapo threw my printing press into a river. But, go, tell your fucking jokes. Bring me my dish.\u201d She said that. Petunia\u2026 Petunia is my best friend in the world. I give her a million kisses a day. She does not like me, and barks at me and bites me all day long. We had to get a dog trainer into the apartment because Petunia is a bad dog. We tell her that every day. We go, \u201cHey, you\u2019re bad at being a dog.\u201d So, the trainer came into the apartment. Sorry, didn\u2019t even walk into the apartment, walked into the threshold and went, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d Like she was an exorcist or something. She said, \u201cI see what the problem is.\u201d She said, \u201cPetunia has become the alpha of the house.\u201d And then she pointed at me, she said, \u201cYou are no longer the alpha of the house.\u201d And in the back of my head, I was like, \u201cI was never the alpha of the house.\u201d I turned to my wife, I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s pretend. It\u2019ll be fun. Yes\u2026 My title of alpha, which I once had, how can I reclaim it? Because that was a thing that existed at one time.\u201d She said, \u201cYou need to show dominance over your puppy.\u201d These are things people say to me. I said, \u201cHow do I do that?\u201d She said, \u201cWell, let me ask you this. Who eats dinner first, you or Petunia?\u201d I was like, \u201cPetunia eats dinner first. She eats dinner at 5:00 p.m., \u2019cause she\u2019s a foot long and two years old.\u201d She said, \u201cNo, you need to eat dinner first. Because the king eats before anyone else eats.\u201d Oh, yes, and what a mighty king I will be, eating dinner at 4:45 in the afternoon. \u201cLook upon your sovereign, Petunia, and tremble. My lands stretch across this entire one bedroom, and I eat dinner whenever I choose, as long as it works for the schedule of a dog.\u201d She said, \u201cNow, you don\u2019t actually have to eat dinner before Petunia. You just have to convince Petunia that you\u2019ve already eaten.\u201d So\u2026 for the past month, I shit you not\u2026 before my wife and I give Petunia her dish, we take down empty bowls and spoons, and in front of her, we go, \u201cMmm, dinner. Mmm, good dinner.\u201d Like we\u2019re space aliens in a play about human beings that they wrote, but they didn\u2019t work that hard on. \u201cMmm, we\u2019re eating dinner.\u201d Meanwhile, Petunia\u2019s just staring at us with her Paul Giamatti face, like\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re not eating dinner, cocksucker. Dish, now.\u201d I have a wife and a dog, and we just bought a house. We have a new house. It was built in the \u201920s, but it was flipped in 2014. Which means it\u2019s haunted, but it has a lovely kitchen backsplash. Actually, we didn\u2019t buy a house. A bank bought a house, and I\u2019m allowed to keep my shirts and pants there while I pay it off for 30 years. The woman from the bank came over and she showed me my mortgage broken down month by month for 30 years. And she said, \u201cSo, for instance, this is what you\u2019ll pay in July of 2029.\u201d And I burst out laughing. I was like, \u201c2029? That\u2019s not a real year. By 2029, I\u2019ll be drinking moon juice with President Jonathan Taylor Thomas. I\u2019m not gonna be writing you a paper check.\u201d I like having a house, but I loved looking for a house, \u2019cause I love real estate agents. I mean, they are the true heroes. They really are. Have you ever watched HGTV? Real estate agents have to deal with the dumbest people in the world making the biggest decisions of their lives. Every episode of HGTV is like, \u201cCraig and Stacia are looking for a two-story A-frame that\u2019s near Craig\u2019s job in the downtown, but also satisfies Stacia\u2019s need to be near the beach which is nowhere near Craig\u2019s job. With three children and nine on the way, and a max budget of $7\u2026 let\u2019s see what Lori Jo can do on this week\u2019s episode of You Don\u2019t Deserve A Beach House.\u201d I loved our real estate agent. It was so fun to hang out with her. It was like hanging out with my mom. \u2018Cause, you know, real estate agents always look like your mom. And they have various Chico\u2019s accoutrements. They always have kind of fun mom energy. And they\u2019re always, \u201cSo excited to see you two.\u201d We would have little conferences before we walked into a house. She\u2019d go, \u201cLet\u2019s talk. Let\u2019s talk before we go in.\u201d We\u2019re, like, two feet from the door. \u201cSo, there\u2019s no toilets. And I know that was on your list. But I think I can get him to budge. Let\u2019s go.\u201d So, we\u2019d have a real estate agent, and then, like, the house would have a real estate agent who\u2019s just some guy sitting in a big chair. And these two always hated each other. They\u2019d be like, \u201cHi, Tony.\u201d \u201cHi, Kim.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cJesus Christ! What, were you two in the Eagles together? What is the animosity about?\u201d Our real estate agent wanted us to have a baby more than anyone else in our lives, more than anyone in our family. She hinted about it constantly. Every room she walked into, she\u2019d be like, \u201cSo, this could be an office.\u201d \u201cOr maybe a nursery.\u201d \u201cYeah. No, like we said, we don\u2019t know if we\u2019re gonna have\u2026 \u201d \u201cNo, no. I know, I know, you know. You don\u2019t know if you\u2019re gonna have \u2019em, but you know. You know, you never know. Sometimes you don\u2019t know what\u2019s gonna happen, and then\u2026 you know, something happens.\u201d \u201cWell, yeah, that\u2019s how all of life works.\u201d \u201cOkay, all right. Okay. Uh-huh. Mmm. This is an on-fire garbage can. Could be a nursery.\u201d She showed me a backyard once. She goes, \u201cI don\u2019t even like this backyard for you.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, do tell.\u201d She said, \u201cIt\u2019s all pavement. I think you should have some grass out there. You know, in case you have a couple\u2026 little guys\u2026 running around in the grass.\u201d And I got offended on behalf of my imaginary kids. I was like, \u201cHey, lady. I went outside about as much as Powder from the movie Powder. My children are not gonna be playing out on grass. They will be up in their rooms playing violent video games and catfishing pedophiles. These are my children. And that\u2019s my wife!\u201d I didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like we don\u2019t want children. We don\u2019t, but I didn\u2019t mean to make it sound like that. See, I just don\u2019t think babies like me very much. Sometimes babies will point at me, and I don\u2019t care for that shit at all. Like, I\u2019ll be on an elevator, and a baby will be there in its big, like, stroller activity tray, just, like, working on one Cheerio with Bobby Fischer-like intensity. And it\u2019ll look up at me and go\u2026 I like to lean in and go, \u201cStop snitchin\u2019, motherfucker.\u201d And then walk off. \u2018Cause you\u2019re never too young to learn our national no-snitching policy. My friends have babies and I don\u2019t do so well with them. I had a run-in with a two-year-old girl. I know there are better ways to start that story, but\u2026 My friend, Jeremy, has this two-year-old girl, and I really like her. She\u2019s a sweet kid. I really like his daughter a lot. But I was over at his family\u2019s house for the Fourth of July, and he had his daughter on his knee. And it was a very lovely day. His whole extended family was there. And he was bouncing his two-year-old up and down, and he pointed at me and he said to his two-year-old, \u201cDo you know who that is? That\u2019s your Uncle John.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, my God. That\u2019s so sweet. I\u2019m her Uncle John.\u201d And then the baby pointed at me and said, \u201cUncle John has a penis.\u201d I thank you for laughing, because no one did that day! Fell deadly silent, is what they all did. Hey, do you know what you\u2019re supposed to say when a baby points at you and knowingly says, \u201cHe has a penis\u201d? No, I\u2019m asking, \u2019cause I don\u2019t know what to say in that situation. Here\u2019s what I went with that day. I said, \u201cOh, come on!\u201d I don\u2019t know. I thought that\u2019d be good. But then it just made it worse, \u2019cause it sounded like the baby and I had an arrangement not to talk about it, and she had violated my trust. Like, the baby had been like, \u201cDo you have a penis?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYes, I do, but you\u2019re a baby, so discretion is key.\u201d And then the next day she goes, \u201cHe has a penis,\u201d and I go, \u201cOh, come on! Someone can\u2019t keep a secret!\u201d Luckily, Jeremy\u2019s wife saved the day. The baby\u2019s mom saved the day. She came in and she picked up the baby, and she was like, \u201cIt\u2019s okay. She\u2019s just going through that phase where she says penis and vagina a lot.\u201d Aren\u2019t we all? And, by the way, it would\u2019ve been a totally different situation if the baby had said vagina. Like, if a grown woman had walked in the room, and the baby had been like, \u201cShe has a vagina,\u201d the woman could be like, \u201cYes, I do, and it\u2019s magnificent.\u201d And we would all be like, \u201cHooray! You are brave!\u201d No one wants to applaud the penis of a 32-year-old weirdo. It\u2019s fun to be married. I\u2019ve never been supervised before. I\u2019m supervised. She studies what I do. Like an anthropologist. She\u2019ll be like, \u201cSometimes, he will watch a movie on TV even though he already owns that movie on DVD. Pointing this out to him confuses and upsets him.\u201d I had no supervision when I was a kid. We were free to do what we wanted. But also, with that, no one cared about kids. I grew up before children were special. I did. Very early \u201980s, right before children became special. Like, I remember when milk carton kids became a thing. When they were like, \u201cHey, we should start looking for some of these guys. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re just blowing off steam.\u201d No one cared about my opinion when I was a little kid. No one cared what I thought. Sometimes, people would say, \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d But that just meant \u201cStop.\u201d They didn\u2019t actually wanna know my thought process. They didn\u2019t want me to be like, \u201cWell, I was gonna put this bottle rocket into this carton of eggs, so that when I lit off the bottle rocket, the eggs would explode everywhere.\u201d \u201cOh, well, that\u2019s very interesting. And what brought you to this experiment?\u201d \u201cOh, well, thank you for asking. Well\u2026 you know how I\u2019m filled with rage? I\u2019m so horny and angry all the time\u2026 and I have no outlet for it. So\u2026 eggs.\u201d Your opinion doesn\u2019t matter in elementary school either. It matters in college. College is just your opinion. Just you raising your hand and being like, \u201cI think Emily Dickinson\u2019s a lesbian.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cPartial credit.\u201d And that\u2019s a whole thing. But in elementary school, it doesn\u2019t matter what you think, it just matters what you know. You have to have answers to questions. And if you say, \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d you get an X on your test, and you get it wrong and that\u2019s not fair, \u2019cause your brain has never been smaller. Also, that\u2019s not how life works. I\u2019m in my 30s now. If you came to me now and you were like, \u201cHey, John, name three things that the Stamp Act of 1775 accomplished.\u201d I\u2019d go, \u201cI don\u2019t know. Get out of my apartment,\u201d you know? But when you\u2019re a little kid, you can\u2019t say, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d You should be able to. That should be an acceptable answer on a test. You should be able to write in, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know you told me. But I have had a very long day. I am very small. And I have no money. So you can imagine the kind of stress that I am under.\u201d Or if it\u2019s one of those true or false questions, you should be able to add a third option which is, \u201cWho\u2019s to say?\u201d Kids are much more supervised now, but also, they have a lot of rights. Like, that\u2019s the biggest civil rights increase I\u2019ve seen in my lifetime. The rights of children have gone through the roof. I had no rights when I was a little kid. I remember, one time, I walked into a supermarket by myself, and I walked in through the double doors, and the woman behind the register just looked at me and she went, \u201cNo!\u201d And I went, \u201cAll right.\u201d And I turned around and left. That\u2019s how broken I was. And there weren\u2019t special things for kids the way there are now. Like, we would just go see movies. Any movie. Like Back to the Future. That was a movie everyone could see. Kids could kinda see it. Great movie, right? I rewatched it recently. It\u2019s a very weird movie. Marty McFly is a 17-year-old high school student whose best friend is a disgraced nuclear physicist. And, I shit you not, they never explain how they became friends. They never explain it. Not even in a lazy way, like, \u201cHey, remember when we met in the science building?\u201d They don\u2019t even do that. And we were all fine with it. We were just like, \u201cWhat, who\u2019s his best friend? A disgraced nuclear physicist? All right, proceed.\u201d What a strange movie to sell to be a family movie. Two guys had to go in and do that. They had to be like, \u201cOkay\u2026 we got an idea\u2026 for the next big family-action-comedy. All right, it\u2019s about a guy named Marty, and he\u2019s very lazy. He\u2019s always sleeping late.\u201d \u201cOkay. Is he cool like Ferris Bueller?\u201d \u201cNo. But he does have this best friend who\u2019s, you know, a disgraced\u2026 nuclear physicist.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m confused here. This best friend, this is another student?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. No, this guy\u2019s either, like, 40 or 80. Even we don\u2019t know how old this guy\u2019s supposed to be. But one day, the boy and the scientist, they go back in time and they build a time machine. Whoa!\u201d \u201cOkay. I think I see where you\u2019re going here. They build a time machine, and they go back in time, and they stop the Kennedy assassination.\u201d \u201cAh! Oh, wow, that\u2019s a really good idea, I mean, we didn\u2019t even think of that.\u201d \u201cAll right, well, what do they do with the time machine?\u201d \u201cWell, now I\u2019m embarrassed to say. Ah, well, all right, all right, all right. We thought\u2026 We thought it would be funny, you know, if the boy, if he went back in time and, you know, he tried to fuck his mom.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know. We thought that\u2019d be fun for people. But, no, good point. No, he doesn\u2019t get to, he doesn\u2019t get to. \u2018Cause this family friend named Biff, he comes in and he tries to rape the mom in front of the son. The dad\u2019s gotta beat the rapist off of her. And also, we\u2019re gonna imply that a white man wrote \u2018Johnny B. Goode.\u2019 So, we\u2019re gonna take that away from \u2019em.\u201d \u201cWell, this is the best movie idea I have ever heard in my life. We\u2019re gonna make three of them. Now, you say they go to the past. How about we call it Back to the Past?\u201d \u201cNo, no, no. Back to the Future.\u201d \u201cRight, but they go to the past.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d Kids have it very good now. My friend\u2019s a teacher. She told me that, uh\u2026 the parents will take the kids\u2019 side over the teacher now. That\u2019s insane. That never happened. My parents trusted every grown-up\u2026 more than they trusted me. I don\u2019t mean coaches and teachers. Any human adult\u2019s word\u2026 was better than mine. Any hobo or drifter could have taken me by the ear up to my front door and been like, \u201cExcuse me! Your kid bit my dick.\u201d And my mom would be like, \u201cJohn Edmund Mulaney, did you bite this nice man\u2019s dick?\u201d And I would be the only one who\u2019s like, \u201cHey, doesn\u2019t anyone wanna know why\u2026 his dick was near my biters\u2026 in the first place? Isn\u2019t anyone curious\u2026 as to how I had access?\u201d Don\u2019t get me wrong, my parents love us. They just didn\u2019t like us. We weren\u2019t friends. People are now like, \u201cMy mom\u2019s my best friend.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh, is she a super bad mom?\u201d My parents didn\u2019t trust us, and they shouldn\u2019t have trusted us. We were little goblins. We were terrible. I remember, one time, we were going to this resort for a vacation when we were little kids. Three weeks before we went to the resort, my dad sat us down and he said, \u201cAll right, we\u2019re going to a resort, and I\u2019ve just been informed that the man who owns the resort only has one arm.\u201d And we were like, \u201cOh, yes! Yay! Yes!\u201d \u201cNow, I\u2019m telling you three weeks in advance, so that you will not freak out when you see that he only has one arm.\u201d \u201cOh, we\u2019re gonna freak out so bad!\u201d \u201cYes, John, you have a question?\u201d \u201cHow did he lose his arm?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what you won\u2019t ask.\u201d And then I did ask. I went into the kitchen one day, and I was like, \u201cSo, how\u2019d you lose your arm?\u201d And he was like, \u201cWell, I was born with only one arm.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNah.\u201d No, my parents loved us. It\u2019s just, like, they were the cops, you know? And we were criminals. So, we didn\u2019t get along. We only got along in that way that, like, cops will sometimes be chummy with criminals. Like, when my dad and I would talk, it was like that scene in the movie Heat, when Robert De Niro and Al Pacino sit down in that diner. We kind of had that rapport of, like, \u201cHmm, we\u2019re not so different, you and I. You have your law practice, and me, I have all these fucking markers.\u201d \u201cI guess we both have responsibilities when you look at it that way.\u201d My dad would respect it if I could get away with breaking a rule. We had a rule in our house, you were not allowed to watch TV on a school night. So, every school night, I would 100% be watching TV. And I would hear my dad coming, I would immediately turn the TV off and grab any book, magazine, periodical, anything. And I\u2019d open it and pretend to be doing homework. My dad would walk in the room and he would go, \u201cWhat are you doing? Are you watching TV?\u201d And I\u2019d go, \u201cNo, man. I\u2019m not watching TV.\u201d And the TV wouldn\u2019t even be dark yet. It would still have, like, a neon green halo around it. It\u2019d be sizzling like a glass of Pepsi. And I would look my dad in the eyes and go, \u201cNo, I\u2019m just reading this Yellow Pages.\u201d My dad loved us. He just didn\u2019t care about our general happiness or self-esteem. I remember, one time, we were really little kids. I have two sisters and a brother, and all four of us were in our family car ride for three hours going to Wisconsin. My dad was driving, going down the highway in our white van with wood around the side. \u2018Cause you remember when you wanted your car to be made of wood? You remember that era? Where we were like, \u201cHow much wood can we get on this car\u2026 without it catching on fire?\u201d But then the big announcement. \u201cWe here at Plymouth-Chrysler can put a saucy stripe of wood safely on the outside of your car, for all those times you\u2019ve looked at your minivan and thought, \u2018Huh! It needs a belt.'\u201d So, we\u2019re going on the highway. We\u2019ve been on the road for three hours. And in the distance, we see a McDonald\u2019s. We see the golden arches. And we got so excited. We started chanting, \u201cMcDonald\u2019s! McDonald\u2019s! McDonald\u2019s! McDonald\u2019s!\u201d And my dad pulled into the drive-thru, and we started cheering. And then, he ordered one black coffee for himself. And kept driving. And, you know, as mad as that made me as a little kid, in retrospect, that is the funniest thing I have ever seen in my entire life. How perfect is that? He had a vanload of little kids, and he got black coffee. The one thing from McDonald\u2019s no child could enjoy. My dad is cold-blooded. He once shushed a kid during Lion King on Broadway. That actually happened. We were at Lion King on Broadway, and there was a five-year-old behind us going, \u201cLook, it\u2019s Pumbaa! Look, it\u2019s Timon!\u201d And my dad turned around and said, \u201cAre you going to talk the entire time?\u201d He\u2019s my hero. The weirdest thing when I was a kid was how much they scared us about smoking weed. They scared us about it constantly. And I\u2019ve been on tour this year\u2026 Marijuana is legal in 18 or 19 states in some form or another. It\u2019s insane. Yeah, well\u2026 All right, don\u2019t \u201cwhoo\u201d if you\u2019re white. It\u2019s always been legal for us. Come on, sir. We don\u2019t go to jail for marijuana, you silly billy. When I was arrested with a one-hitter at a Rusted Root concert, I did not serve hard time. I think I got an award. Eighteen or 19 states. And, by the way, I agree, it\u2019s a very good thing. But it\u2019s also a really weird thing, because this is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a law change because the government is just like, \u201cFine.\u201d You know? I\u2019ve never seen it before. Like, gay marriage and healthcare, we have to battle it out in the Supreme Court, and be like, \u201cGay people are humans.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cWe\u2019ll think about it.\u201d But with weed, it was just something we wanted really badly, and we kept asking them for 40 years, like, \u201cExcuse me.\u201d And then suddenly the government became like cool parents, and they\u2019re just like, \u201cOkay, here. Take a little. We\u2019d rather you do it in the house than go somewhere else\u2026 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\u201d Those stupid parents. And that\u2019s a big deal because they scared us about weed constantly. It would be on our sitcoms. We\u2019d be watching Saved by the Bell, we\u2019d be having a great old time. And then, suddenly, a character we had not seen before would show up with some weed and the episode would stop cold in its tracks. And they\u2019d always hold the joint\u2026 The bad guy would hold the joint in a villainous way. They\u2019d always offer the joint in a way that no one ever holds a joint. Like it\u2019s a skull in a Shakespeare play. And now it\u2019s legal, and that is great news. Unless you\u2019re a weed dealer, and then it is terrible news. And I don\u2019t just mean because they\u2019re about to lose out to Amazon.com. I more feel bad for weed dealers \u2019cause they\u2019re about to find out that we only showed them a certain amount of politeness because they had an illegal product. And we don\u2019t show that same politeness to people who deliver legal products. Like, when the Chinese food delivery guy comes, we don\u2019t let him hang out after he\u2019s delivered the Chinese food. And we don\u2019t look the other way when he says weird shit to the girls we\u2019re hanging out with\u2026 to try to preserve the relationship. And we definitely don\u2019t give him some of the Chinese food. He\u2019s never like, \u201cHey, can I get in on those dumplings?\u201d And we\u2019re like, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re all friends.\u201d What are you, on your phone? Hey, V-neck. Hey! \u2013 What\u2019s your name? \u2013 Sam. Sam? Cool! What do you do to afford V-necks, Sam? Typing numbers. Ah\u2026 numbers, the letters of math. I\u2019m sorry to bother you. I don\u2019t mean to single you out. I hate when people get pulled out of the audience. Like, are you familiar with the Cirque du Soleil, Sam? They\u2019re a group of French assholes that are slowly taking over America by humiliating audience members one by one. We once went to see Cirque du Soleil at Navy Pier when I was a kid, and my brother came, and he was 12 years old. You remember being 12, when you\u2019re like, \u201cNo one look at me or I\u2019ll kill myself.\u201d And these French bastards come into the crowd, being like, \u201cLe volunteer!\u201d And they pulled my brother up on stage, and I was like, \u201cNo!\u201d And they brought him up, and they reached into his sweatshirt, and they were like\u2026 And they had planted a bra, and they pulled out a bra and they were like\u2026 And everyone at Navy Pier was like \u201cAh, ha, ha, ha, ha!\u201d And my brother was like, \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d I have had other jobs besides comedy. I was an office temp for a while. I really miss that. I loved being a temp, because I would just go from office to office and be terrible at a different job for a week. And then you just get to retire like Lou Gehrig. You\u2019re like, \u201cThank you. No one will ever see me again.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cGoodbye!\u201d I worked at an office once on 57th Street in New York City. I was there for a couple weeks. I was in a cubicle next to this other cubicle. This woman named Mischa sat in the other cubicle. I want to get the number right. I think Mischa had\u2026 about 900,000 photos of her daughter up in her cubicle. Almost like she was trying to solve a conspiracy about her daughter, A Beautiful Mind-style. I think about Mischa two times a week\u2026 because of a phone call she had next to me one day. It was one of my first days, and I was sitting next to her. And her phone rang, and this was her call, and I\u2019m quoting. Her phone rang and she said, \u201cHello? Hush!\u201d And then she hung up. Think about that two times a week. And I didn\u2019t know her well enough by then to be like, \u201cHey, what kind of a person are you?\u201d You know? Who could she have been talking to? \u201cHello? Hush!\u201d This was a place of business. My only thought was that it was the CEO of the company being like, \u201cMischa, help. I\u2019m doing a crossword puzzle. I need a four-letter word for \u2018be quiet\u2019 right now.\u201d \u2013 \u201cHush!\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re promoted.\u201d I temped at a little web company on 25th Street in New York City. It was a small web company owned by this old man who was old, old, old money New York. His name was Henry J. Finch IV. Like old, old, old money. Like, his money was in molasses or something. He owned this web company. I have no idea why he owned this web company. I think he won it in a rich man\u2019s game of dice and small binoculars, or something. Mr. Finch wore linen suits. He had suspenders, he had a bow tie, he had a hat, he had a cane with an ivory handle. I\u2019m giving you more description than you need, \u2019cause I need you to believe me. This was a real person I knew in the 21st century. Mr. Finch was in his 70s. He had an assistant named Mary. She was in her 50s, she was Korean. I don\u2019t know why he had an assistant. He did not need one. Unless he needed someone to be like, \u201cRemember, Mr. Finch, at five o\u2019clock, you need to keep looking like a hard-boiled egg.\u201d One day, Mr. Finch came into the office. It had been raining. Everything I\u2019m about to say to you was said in front of me on that afternoon. Mr. Finch walked into the office, and he was wearing a raincoat, he was wearing a rain hat, and he had his cane. And he walked in and he said, and I\u2019m quoting, \u201cAh! One feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet! And when one feels like a duck, one is happy!\u201d And then Mary yelled, \u201cOoh, ducklings!\u201d To which Mr. Finch replied, \u201cToo old to be a duckling. Quack, quack.\u201d And then walked into his office. I think about that every goddamn day. I mean, imagine you\u2019re me. You\u2019re a 22-year-old temp, and you\u2019re so hungover, and you just wanna die every day. And then that happens in front of you, and I don\u2019t know, gives you hope? And I did that a little fast. Let me break that conversation down for you. Mr. Finch walked in, and he began a conversation the way anyone would. \u201cAh!\u201d \u201cOne feels like a duck splashing around in all this wet!\u201d The rain. \u201cAnd when one feels like a duck, one is happy!\u201d Now, that\u2019s debatable. But rather than debate that point, Mary brought up a new, separate, but interesting point\u2026 which was, \u201cDucklings!\u201d But Mr. Finch, ever the realist about his own age and mortality\u2026 said, \u201cAh, too old to be a duckling!\u201d As if to say, \u201cMy duckling days are behind me. Mary, don\u2019t you see? I\u2019m a duck now. And to prove it\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll say just about the most famous catchphrase a duck has\u2026 \u2018Quack, quack.'\u201d And I knew right at that moment, by the way, that it meant nothing to Mr. Finch, what he had said. Crazy people are like that. They have unlimited crazy currency. Like, if I had gone into his office a couple weeks later and been like, \u201cHey, Finch, you remember that time you were like, \u2018Too old to be a duckling. Quack, quack\u2019?\u201d He would just be like, \u201cAh, perhaps I did quack! But such is life for an old knickerbocker like me.\u201d Like, he\u2019d say something else crazy. That\u2019s the wonderful thing about crazy people, you know? Is that they just have unlimited currency. The things they say mean nothing to them, but they mean everything to me. I was once walking into Penn Station in New York. I was walking down 31st Street towards Eighth Avenue. I\u2019m walking down 31st, there\u2019s this woman standing at Eighth and 31st. I have my little roller suitcase. You can all imagine. I\u2019m walking towards her. She\u2019s smoking a cigarette that is not lit anymore. She\u2019s watching me walk, kind of scanning me up and down, as if she had Terminator vision\u2026 where she could see little bits of data, like, \u201cLittle honky ass,\u201d and could read information. As I walked past her, she said this to me. I walked past her and she said, and I\u2019m quoting, \u201cEat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.\u201d Very dirty, yes? A very upsetting thing to hear, yes? I\u2019m sorry you all had to hear that, but at least you all got to hear it as a group. I was alone out there that afternoon. And she said this totally unprompted. \u201cEat ass, suck a dick and sell drugs.\u201d It wasn\u2019t like I had paused in front of her and been like, \u201cWhat should I do with my life?\u201d So, I walk away from her with this to-do list. And I like structure, I like a to-do list. It did dawn on me that that list of things does get better as it goes along, when you really think about it. \u2018Cause it starts in a pretty rough place. It starts with just about the worst task a to-do list can start with. But by the end, you have your own small business. And isn\u2019t that the American dream when all\u2019s said and done? That if you eat enough ass and suck enough dick, one day you can sell drugs. Imagine you did all that to sell drugs and then they legalize drugs, and you were like, \u201cBut I\u2026\u201d This has been a real thrill to perform here, by the way. I just wanna say that in all sincerity. Thanks for coming to this. Really, really appreciate it. I wanna tell you one more story before I get out of here, about the night I met a guy named Bill Clinton. Now, I don\u2019t\u2026 Some of you know who that is? For those of you that don\u2019t, he was President of the United States from 1993 until 2001, and he is a smooth and fantastic hillbilly who should be declared Emperor of the United States of America. Now, I know you know who Bill Clinton is. But I was doing a show at a college, and I mentioned Bill Clinton, and, like, they kind of didn\u2019t know who he was. Like, sorry, they knew the name, right? But they only knew this 2015 Bill Clinton, who\u2019s a very different Bill Clinton. Have you seen his ass lately? What the hell is he trying to pull? He\u2019s all thin now, and he wears these little tight suits, and he\u2019s got these grandpa reading glasses, like, \u201cHey, I can\u2019t do nothing to nobody no more.\u201d \u201cOh, me? I\u2019m just an old, old man. I don\u2019t have the appetites.\u201d You know? And he\u2019s always flying around the world with Bill Gates trying to cure AIDS.\nThat is not the Bill Clinton that we all signed up for 20 years ago. Our Bill Clinton was like a big, fat Buddy Garrity from Friday Night Lights-looking guy, who played the saxophone on Arsenio, and his work in the STD community was not in curing anything at that time. That was the man we all elected president. That was the Bill Clinton that I met. I got to meet Bill Clinton when he was Governor Clinton in 1992, when he was first running for president.\nAnd I got to meet Bill Clinton because my parents had gone to the same college as Bill Clinton. They\u2019re a little younger, but they went to the same college. So, when he was first running for president, he would have all these big, like, alumni fundraisers, and everyone who went was invited to go. Now, this was really cool for a couple reasons. One, I got to meet Bill Clinton. But two, I got to watch my parents watch someone they went to school with become the president. And that is super funny to see, \u2019cause think about some of the people you went to school with. Now imagine they\u2019re becoming the president. Imagine Sam was becoming the president. It would stir up strong emotions. And my parents had very different opinions on Bill Clinton. My mom loved Bill Clinton, \u2019cause Bill Clinton was always a really charismatic, handsome guy. I mean, think about how many women he got in the 1990s when he looked like Frank Caliendo doing John Madden. Now\u2026 imagine him as a college student. And my mom tells me that there was this sort of chivalrous policy on campus back then, where, late at night, if female students were leaving the library unaccompanied, male students were encouraged to wait out in front and offer to walk them home. That sounds good, right? So, my mom tells me that Bill Clinton would be out in front of the library every single night\u2026 just being like, \u201cHey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home? Hey, can I walk ya home?\u201d And one night, my mom was leaving the library, and Bill Clinton was like, \u201cHey, can I walk ya home?\u201d And my mom was like, \u201cHell, yes.\u201d So\u2026 This is absolutely true. My mom, little Ellen Stanton, walked arm-in-arm with Bill Clinton to her dorm. And she was like, \u201cYou know, I wanted to invite him up for a beer.\u201d And I was like, \u201cThanks, I\u2019m nine.\u201d But\u2026 her roommate was upstairs, so she lost her chance with Bill Clinton. Now, my dad, on the other hand, hated Bill Clinton, because my parents were dating during this time. And also, my dad\u2019s a much more morally-upright, conservative kind of guy. He always told me that he hated it in college that Bill Clinton could, quote, \u201cGet away with anything.\u201d Can you imagine how he felt later?\nSo, one day, this invitation arrives for a fundraiser where you could meet Bill Clinton. My mom opens it first and she goes, \u201cOh, we have to go. We have to go see Bill.\u201d And without looking up at her, my dad just says, \u201cWhy? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s gonna remember you.\u201d One black coffee. Same motherfucker. So, my mom says, \u201cFine! I\u2019ll go and I\u2019ll take John.\u201d And I was like, \u201cHell, yeah.\u201d And I slid in the room in my First Communion suit, ready to go. \u2018Cause I loved Bill Clinton. I was ten years old. If you were a kid when Bill Clinton was first released, it was the most exciting thing ever. We\u2019d never seen a cool politician before. And he would go on MTV, and he\u2019d have cool answers to kids\u2019 questions. They\u2019d be like, \u201cGovernor, what\u2019s your favorite food?\u201d And he\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t know, fries?\u201d And we\u2019d be like, \u201cYay, we eat fries!\u201d I learned to play his campaign song on the piano. It was \u201cDon\u2019t Stop\u201d by Fleetwood Mac\u2026 from Rumours, an album written by and for people cheating on each other. He let us know who he was right away. So, I went with my mom, as her date\u2026 to reconnect with Governor Bill Clinton. We walked into the ballroom. It was a big hotel ballroom. It was the Palmer House Hilton, big Hilton hotel ballroom. Walked into the ballroom, it was packed with people. It\u2019s actually the ballroom from the end of the movie The Fugitive, remember? So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it\u2019s packed with people, the\u2026 Sorry, the end where Harrison Ford, as Dr. Richard Kimble, bursts in to confront Dr. Charles Nichols, right? Okay. So, that ballroom. So, my mom and I walk in, it\u2019s packed with people. Why does Kimble confront Nichols? Well, I know we all know this, but\u2026 No, no. But, but, but\u2026 Kimble, he found out that Nichols, along with Devlin MacGregor and Lentz, who has mysteriously died, they had hired Frederick Sykes, the one-armed man, to kill Kimble. Kimble\u2019s wife wasn\u2019t even the target. I know we all know this. But they were gonna kill Kimble because he wasn\u2019t gonna approve certain liver samples to pass RUD-90. So, Kimble finds out about all of this, and, of course, he\u2019s furious. And he bursts into the ballroom and he goes, \u201cYou switched the samples!\u201d And Dr. Nichols is like, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, my friend, Dr. Richard Kimble.\u201d What accent did that guy have, by the way? He goes, \u201cYou switched the samples! And you doctored your research! So that you could have Provasic!\u201d Anyway, so it\u2019s that ballroom. So, we walk into that ballroom. It was packed with people. It was packed with people. A real Who\u2019s Not of Chicago celebrities. Walter Jacobson was there. Walter Jacobson was the local Fox anchor. He\u2019d do fun things where he\u2019d go undercover as a homeless person. And he\u2019d be like, \u201cOh, what time is the soup?\u201d And they\u2019d be like, \u201cMan, you\u2019re Walter Jacobson.\u201d He was there. Everybody. And on the far side of the ballroom, under a spotlight, we saw a little bit of silver hair. And it was him\u2026 Bill Clinton. The Comeback Kid. But he was surrounded by reporters, and photographers, and Secret Service. So, what are you gonna do? Well, if you\u2019re my mom, you ball up the back of my sport coat, and you push me forward like a human shield. And then you start jogging while yelling, \u201cThis ten-year-old boy has to meet the next president of the United States!\u201d Kind of implying that I might be dying. My feet were not on the ground. She was swinging me like a snowplow. I was just mowing down fat Chicago Democrats. I pushed past all the reporters, I pushed past all the photographers. We pushed past all the Secret Service. We land at Bill Clinton\u2019s feet. Bill Clinton turns, looks at my mom and says, \u201cHey, Ellen,\u201d \u2019cause he never forgets a bitch, ever. My mom melts. She goes, \u201cHi, Bill.\u201d Then it is revealed that she has no plan. So\u2026 she pushes me towards Clinton and she goes, \u201cThis is my son, John, and he\u2019s also going to be president.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I\u2019m not gonna be president.\u201d And I know now that I\u2019m definitely never gonna be president. Not unless everyone gets real cool about a bunch of stuff really quickly. Based on my ten-year-old memory, Bill Clinton is about 13 feet tall. And he leaned down, because, well, I was wearing this button that I bought outside the fundraiser. It was a cartoon button of George H. W. Bush, and it had a quail flying over his head, and it was shitting on his head. And it said, \u201cBird-brained.\u201d And I thought it was very funny. And Bill Clinton leaned down so that only I could hear and he said, \u201cHey, man, I like your button.\u201d And I said, \u201cYou can do whatever you want forever.\u201d And he took my advice. And\u2026 it was the best night of my entire life. And I got home that night\u2026 I got home that night, and my dad was still awake, like, reading angry under one lamp, just like\u2026 And I went up to him and I went, \u201cHey! I\u2019m gonna be a Democrat.\u201d \u201cAnd I\u2019m gonna vote for Bill Clinton.\u201d And without looking up at me, my dad just said, \u201cYou have the moral backbone of a chocolate \u00e9clair.\u201d You know, how you talk to a child. So, here\u2019s the end of that story. That was 1992.\nLet\u2019s flash forward five years to 1997. It is now 1997. I am a sophomore in high school, Bill Clinton is in his second term as president. And on the morning that the Monica Lewinsky scandal breaks on the cover of The New York Times. It had been on the Drudge Report, and then it was on the cover of The New York Times. That morning, I wake up to the newspaper hitting me in the face. I am a teenager asleep in bed, and the newspaper hits me in the face and falls open on my stomach. And I open my eyes to see my dad standing there dressed for work, and he says, \u201cThe other shoe just dropped.\u201d And then my dad went in to work to find out that his law firm had been hired to defend Bill Clinton. Good night, Chicago.","louis":"Intro\nFade the music out. Let\u2019s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I don\u2019t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. That\u2019s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in a\u2013 There\u2019s no value to your doing that at all. \u201cThe Old Lady And The Dog\u201d\nI live\u2013 I live in New York. I always\u2013 Like, there\u2019s this old lady in my neighborhood, And she\u2019s always walking her dog. She\u2019s always just\u2013 she\u2019s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, just\u2013 The two of them, it\u2019s really\u2013 The dog\u2019s got a cloudy eye, and she\u2019s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, and\u2013 And she\u2019s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5\u201910\u201d, But now it\u2019s just, like, this sweater And her legs are\u2013 her legs are a nightmare. They\u2019re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, \u201cyecch, no thank you. \u201cI do not want those. \u201cI\u2019d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.\u201d I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, \u201cgod, I hope she dies first.\u201d I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I don\u2019t want her to lose the dog. I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be able to handle it. If she dies\u2013 If the old lady dies first, I\u2019m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesn\u2019t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. He\u2019s living in two-second increments. The second he\u2019s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, she\u2019s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know he\u2019s all she has because she has him. There\u2019s no\u2013 If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, \u201cgood morning, gladys,\u201d She\u2019d be like, \u201cgood,\u201d And just flush him down the toilet, just\u2013 Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! \u201c\u201d she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom! \u201cMy Daughter Likes Fish\u201d\nYou ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughter\u2019s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasn\u2019t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And that\u2019s a weird moment, too, \u2019cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, \u201cyeah, he\u2019s dead,\u201d And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, \u201cwait a second! Aw, shit! \u201cI was taking a nap! Jesus! \u201cyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.\u201d And then my daughter comes home. \u201cwhy did he die, da\u2013\u201d Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? That\u2019s the reason. That\u2019s the actual reason, is because didn\u2019t matter That he was alive. That\u2019s why he\u2019s dead. He didn\u2019t know his name, and he didn\u2019t love you back. These are the facts about that fish\u2019s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I don\u2019t know which one. I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t think they need to be separate things. I really don\u2019t. They don\u2019t care, and we don\u2019t care. There\u2019s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, \u201cok, everybody. \u201cfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, And\u2013you know what?\u2013Penguins are all seals now,\u201d And we would all be like, \u201cyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.\u201d Anyway, so we\u2019re looking at this seal\/sea lion thing, And he\u2019s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And he\u2019s going\u2013 They\u2019re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think you\u2019re gonna see little, white sheep Going, \u201cbaa,\u201d but they\u2019re all fat and shit-colored, And they\u2019re like\u2013 Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals don\u2019t go\u2013 They go\u2013 My daughter\u2019s like, \u201cwhat is he saying?\u201d I don\u2019t know! \u201cI\u2019m a slave! Kill me!\u201d \u201cThe Food Chain\u201d\nMust be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? I\u2019m glad I\u2019m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, you\u2019re in the food chain. You\u2019re in the food\u2013 we are out of the food chain. I don\u2019t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. That\u2019s how all life ends, is\u2013 Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! We\u2019re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just \u201cI love you. Bye.\u201d I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. You\u2019re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. You\u2019re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and it\u2019s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, \u201cbeh,\u201d and you\u2019re like, \u201cfine,\u201d And it\u2019s just, \u201cwhy?\u201d You get a thing in the mail That says that your phone\u2019s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I don\u2019t get it! Then you\u2019re walking to work like, \u201cwhy do I even bother? \u201cshit! Goddamn it! \u201cthere\u2019s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!\u201d You think that sharks\u2013 Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think they\u2019d be bummed \u2019cause I don\u2019t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think they\u2019re slick. They swim around like, \u201chey, nobody has any idea what\u2019s down here,\u201d And we\u2019re all up here like, \u201cthere\u2019s totally a shark right there.\u201d It wouldn\u2019t be fun being a predator, either. If you\u2019re a predator, imagine if every time you\u2019re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Who\u2019s running for his life. You gotta\u2013 \u201ccome on, dude! Shit, get over here!\u201d And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. That\u2019s why animals just\u2013 They go, \u201clet\u2019s do this together, man. \u201cyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.\u201d That\u2019s why they do it like that. \u201cfuck it. I\u2019m eating babies. This is bullshit.\u201d \u201cgrownups ain\u2019t worth the meat.\u201d Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isn\u2019t a gay voice, by the way. It\u2019s not. Shut up. yeah. \u201cCourtyard Confrontation\u201d\nI live in New York city, and it\u2019s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didn\u2019t. Didn\u2019t matter. I was a child. But I\u2019m not used to it \u2019cause it\u2019s nice. There\u2019s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I don\u2019t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You can\u2019t get a fountain made without\u2013 \u201ccan you make me a fountain?\u201d \u201cyes, I\u2019ll get started right away! \u201cYes! Yes! It\u2019s finished!\u201d And it\u2019s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. \u201cjust piss on me forever!\u201d Anyway, there\u2019s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didn\u2019t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. That\u2019s my least presentable hour. There\u2019s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whatever\u2026 And so I\u2019m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. I\u2019m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, there\u2019s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then there\u2019s this guy looking at me. I notice he\u2019s looking at me from across the courtyard, And he\u2019s all spiffy-looking. He\u2019s got brown shoes, and he\u2019s looking at me like, \u201c\u201d I can tell he was thinking I don\u2019t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell he\u2019s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and I\u2019m sitting there thinking, Like, \u201cplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,\u201d And I\u2019m trying to look even more gross, And I\u2019m, like, pulling up my shirt, \u201c\u201d And then I see him go, \u201cno. That\u2019s not gonna do at all,\u201d And he comes over to me, \u201c\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cNum num num!\u201d I\u2019m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where I\u2019m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. \u201crrgh!\u201d So he comes over, says, \u201cexcuse me, \u201cdo you live in this building?\u201d And I said, \u201cno,\u201d \u2019cause why not start there? I said, \u201cno.\u201d He goes, \u201cwell then, what are you doing here?\u201d And I said, \u201cI just need to rest. I\u2019m having a hard time.\u201d He says, \u201cthis is private property,\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, I don\u2019t really believe in that.\u201d You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, \u201cwell, if you don\u2019t leave, I\u2019m gonna talk to the doorman.\u201d I was like, \u201ccan I just stay, like, five more hours?\u201d So he\u2019s\u2013\u201cno,\u201d and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, \u201cno. That guy lives here. It\u2019s OK,\u201d And the look on his face\u2013 mwah mwah! Num num!\u2013 It was just so\u2013 It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. It\u2019s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebody\u2019s feelings. That\u2019s how excited I was. \u201cGetting What \u2018Old\u2019 Is\u201d\nI\u2019m 45 now, So I\u2019m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I don\u2019t know which one. I won\u2019t know till it\u2019s over where this was. I don\u2019t know how long I\u2019m gonna live. I don\u2019t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, \u201cthat\u2019s too bad.\u201d If I die five years from now, they\u2019ll be like, \u201cwell, all right,\u201d like it\u2019s not even\u2013 It\u2019s\u2013 Like, as soon as you\u2019re 50, you\u2019re a candidate. You know, there\u2019s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushing\u2013 You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then they\u2019re in the news, and it\u2019s always some old guy, \u201cI met Napoleon.\u201d No, you didn\u2019t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, you\u2019re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didn\u2019t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where I\u2019m like, \u201cwow, this seems early for this.\u201d Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. I\u2019ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, I\u2019ll realize, \u201cI need to wipe my ass right now.\u201d \u201cI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.\u201d Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? I\u2019m 45. Already, my asshole\u2019s just like, \u201cJust\u2013 \u201d My asshole\u2013 My asshole\u2019s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kinda\u2026 Loose and ineffectual. My asshole\u2019s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. It\u2019s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. \u201crats.\u201d That\u2019s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Here\u2019s another thing about my age right now. If I\u2019m\u2013 OK. Say I\u2019m sitting down. If I\u2019m sitting anywhere, which\u2013ha ha ha!\u2013 I love sitting so much\u2013 I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is what\u2013 At my age, if I\u2019m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. \u201cwhat? Why do I\u2013 no. Why, though?\u201d \u201cYour car is being towed right now!\u201d \u201cWell, that\u2019s what happens to me, then. That\u2019s\u2013 I accept that.\u201d \u2019cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, \u201cdo I really want to be alive anymore?\u201d Like, let\u2019s start with that, And then I gotta, \u201c\u201d start kind of rocking to get momentum, \u201c\u201d like I\u2019m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. \u201cshit.\u201d \u201cPutting On Socks\u201d\nThe worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks because\u2013 Putting on my socks, that means I have to\u2013 Here\u2019s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I don\u2019t even know how I do it. I\u2019m sitting here. I don\u2019t know how I do that. It\u2019s \u2019cause you have to\u2013 It\u2019s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feel\u2013 I\u2019m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. \u201cbeep, beep, beep!\u201d And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other people\u2019s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinson\u2019s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said it\u2019s agony, And I saw this and I thought, \u201cOK. That\u2019s hard.\u201d That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesn\u2019t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. I\u2019ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks. \u201cIf You\u2019re Older You\u2019re Smarter\u201d\nI don\u2019t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if you\u2019re older, you\u2019re smarter. I just believe that. If you\u2019re in an argument with somebody And they\u2019re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re right. It means that even if they\u2019re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. They\u2019ve been there longer. If you\u2019re older, you\u2019re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. That\u2019s about 60 people out of 2,400. Here\u2019s the interesting thing. There\u2019s way more. I can see you. There\u2019s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didn\u2019t clap. Why? \u2019cause they\u2019re smart. They\u2019re sitting in the dark going, \u201cI don\u2019t have to clap. I don\u2019t have to do anything.\u201d They\u2019re not doing it, and they\u2019re right. You know why? \u2019cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You don\u2019t know why I\u2019m asking. How do you know what\u2013 OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know I\u2019m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. That\u2019s every time. \u201cWhoo! Whoo!\u201d every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where you\u2019re not the only people here. That\u2019s like going to a cancer ward\u2013 \u201cnot me! Whoo! I don\u2019t have it! I don\u2019t have it!\u201d If you\u2019re older, you\u2019re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, \u2019cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. He\u2019s worthless. The garbage man is 55. He\u2019s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fair\u2026 From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? He\u2019s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. He\u2019s seen more. He\u2019s seen history. He\u2019s witnessed history, Even if it\u2019s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy \u2019cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, \u201cthe president\u2019s kind of disappointing.\u201d Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew away\u2026 And the whole nation just watched him go. \u201cGetting Older Makes My Life Better\u201d\nI like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, \u2019cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when they\u2019re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They don\u2019t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adam\u2019s apple and a smelly t-shirt. \u201chey, I\u2019m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.\u201d \u201cso where do I\u2013 everywhere? OK. Cool.\u201d But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. I\u2019d like to make one of those \u201cit gets better\u201d ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, \u201clisten, man. \u201cI know it\u2019s tough right now. \u201cYou\u2019re vaguely heavy with no face. \u201cYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. \u201cYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, \u201cbut it gets better because you\u2019ll all grow up, \u201cand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, \u201cand they don\u2019t. \u201cTheir options start running out really fast, \u201cand you\u2019re gonna be there. \u201cAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, \u201cyou\u2019re gonna be amazing in your 40s. \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be\u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re gonna be the branch that she can grab \u201cbefore she hits the ground. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be so great. \u201cIt just takes time for her circumstances \u201cto match your looks, but it\u2019s gonna happen. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna happen. \u201cWhen real shit matters, you\u2019re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.\u201d It\u2019s just time. That\u2019s all it takes. There\u2019s a formula to this. It\u2019s pussy plus time over income squared. \u201cEverybody Has Their Time\u201d\nEverybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who there\u2019s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, \u201cthere\u2019s someone for everyone.\u201d Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it \u2019cause it\u2019s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who we\u2019ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. That\u2019s all that happens, \u201caww,\u201d and if you\u2019re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. \u201cAww.\u201d Well, go fuck one. \u201cNah.\u201d I didn\u2019t think so. That\u2019s the one way we\u2019re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, \u201cyeah. No. You should. I\u2019m totally up. Yeah.\u201d \u201cDating Takes Courage\u201d\nIt\u2019s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really is\u2013 It\u2019s how we evolve, is dating. It\u2019s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think it\u2019s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, I\u2019m always happy when I see a couple on a date \u2019cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means there\u2019s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If she\u2019s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, \u201cjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Don\u2019t do this!\u201d But he walked up and said, \u201chi. Yes,\u201d And she\u2019s like, \u201c\u201d \u201cno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,\u201d And you try to get through this membrane of, you know\u2013 And then, if it works And you say, \u201cyou wanna go out sometime?\u201d Sometimes she\u2019ll say yes, and if she says yes, that\u2019s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole species\u2019 existence counts on them doing it, and I don\u2019t know how they\u2013 How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? We\u2019re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, we\u2019re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. We\u2019re the worst thing that ever happens to them. That\u2019s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. That\u2019s the whole thing. That\u2019s it, just our own heart going, \u201cdude, I can\u2019t\u2013 \u201cyou can\u2019t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,\u201d But women still\u2013 \u201cyeah. I\u2019ll go out with you alone at night.\u201d What are you, nuts? \u201cI\u2019ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?\u201d \u201cTo your death, statistically.\u201d How do they still do it? If you\u2019re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And you\u2019re like, \u201cI hope this one\u2019s nice. I hope he doesn\u2019t do what he\u2019s going to do.\u201d \u201cFirst Date\u201d\nI always\u2013 I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell it\u2019s the first date \u2019cause of the way they\u2019re walking together And she\u2019s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And he\u2019s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. He\u2019s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesive\u2013 Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, \u201cwell\u2026 \u201cha ha! \u201cwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrgh\u2026\u201d Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date that\u2019s later down the line and something has happened. There\u2019s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness \u2019cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, \u201cI\u2019m gonna let him fuck me.\u201d They just get to decide. Something he says, and she\u2019s like, \u201cthat was good. He\u2019s gonna fuck me later,\u201d And he has no idea. He\u2019s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea he\u2019s already in there. \u201cTits\u201d\nGuys are\u2013 We love women a lot\u2013 all men do\u2013 And we just look at you. That\u2019s what I do. I just look at women. I just\u2013\u201c\u201d Like they\u2019re, you know, cakes in windows. I just\u2013\u201c\u201d I was walking in New York once, and there\u2019s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, \u2019cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like that\u2019s gonna help me in any way, to hear their\u2013 \u201cdon\u2019t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?\u201d OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. It\u2019s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If you\u2019re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, \u201ccould you squeeze my tit for one second?\u201d And 100% of us will go, \u201cyes, of course.\u201d That doesn\u2019t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. \u201cyeah. Ok.\u201d Beep! \u201cdon\u2019t worry. He\u2019s not your tits. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d I don\u2019t know why we love tits so much. Some people say it\u2019s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, don\u2019t usually\u2013 You don\u2019t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately look\u2013 You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young woman\u2019s tit. \u201cthank you, Deborah. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.\u201d It\u2019s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of \u201cthe grapes of wrath,\u201d Which I don\u2019t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I don\u2019t know if you read \u201cthe grapes of wrath,\u201d But that\u2019s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girl\u2019s tits, And then the book is over, and you\u2019re like, \u201cJesus! What happened at the end there? That\u2019s crazy.\u201d There\u2019s no other book in that genre. There\u2019s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the very\u2013 \u201cand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.\u201d \u201choly moly with that!\u201d \u201cthe end.\u201d \u201cmy god! \u201cthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. I\u2019ve been reading this book for three months.\u201d But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded place\u2013 Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadium\u2013 And you\u2019re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, you\u2019re like, \u201cthat\u2019s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!\u201d Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, \u2019cause you could drive a tack in there, I\u2019m not gonna feel it, But a tit\u2013 Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehow\u2026 \u201cit\u2019s a tit! I touched a tit! \u201cI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.\u201d That\u2019s rare, to touch one tit. It\u2019s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didn\u2019t have permission, But otherwise\u2026 When tit access is granted, It\u2019s usually good for two tits at a time. It\u2019s, once you\u2019re on one\u2013 You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didn\u2019t get the second one. \u201cyeah, it\u2019s like your mom\u2019s dirty whore tit.\u201d \u201cwhy? What? I said I liked it. \u201cthat\u2019s what I meant, is that I like it. \u201cI like your mom\u2019s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,\u201d And if it\u2019s up to the guy, we\u2019re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, \u201cyou know what? \u201cI\u2019m good with the one. That\u2019s fine for me. Everything in moderation.\u201d We\u2019re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle of\u2013 \u201cyeah\u2013\u201d \u201cthere\u2019s a bomb!\u201d \u201cshit! Come on, let\u2019s get\u2013 \u201ccome on! Let\u2019s get your tits out of here!\u201d \u201cDivorce\u201d\nI\u2019ve seen a few tits. I\u2019ve seen\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2013 48 maybe. I don\u2019t know. I had my history in my life, you know? I\u2019ve been divorced for five years, And it\u2019s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, I\u2019m not saying don\u2019t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because that\u2019s the best part. It\u2019s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everything\u2019s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, \u201d my divorce is falling apart. It\u2019s over. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d And again, if you\u2019re in a good marriage, stay in it. If you\u2019re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. I\u2019m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. That\u2019s just a fact. I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m sorry, but it\u2019s true. Everything\u2019s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. We\u2019re good co-parents because we live apart and we\u2019re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and I\u2019m a good father. I\u2019m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? \u2018Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? It\u2019s like every parent\u2019s fantasy. Who can\u2019t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, \u201cgood-bye, girls. \u201cDaddy\u2019s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.\u201d That\u2019s why I\u2019m such a good dad. \u201cVideoing Your Kids\u201d\nMy daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybody\u2019s there, and everybody\u2019s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch \u2019cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kids\u2013 I went over by the stage and the kids\u2013 There\u2019s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like we\u2019re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids can\u2019t see their parents, And everybody\u2019s watching a shitty movie Of something that\u2019s happening ten feet\u2013 Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. It\u2019s totally HD. Why are you taping this? You\u2019re never gonna watch it. In a million years, you\u2019re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You don\u2019t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. \u201chere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.\u201d And then you get to read all the comments. \u201cmy god! \u201cit\u2019s so cute! Ngaah!\u201d And guess what? They\u2019re not watching it, either. They\u2019re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, \u201cthat\u2019s very nice. OK. Back to this.\u201d Nobody\u2019s watching your kids\u2019 videos on Facebook, I promise you. I\u2019ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kid\u2019s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. \u201cThat\u2019s adorable! I think I see a future star!\u201d \u201cLife Is A Good Deal\u201d\nDon\u2019t tape shit on your\u2013 Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it \u2019cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, that\u2019s an ama\u2013 Here\u2019s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of all\u2013my god\u2013 what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. It\u2019s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head \u2019cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as you\u2019re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesn\u2019t matter who\u2019s president or anything, You just\u2013\u201c\u201d Every time I\u2019m eating bacon, I think, \u201cI could die right now,\u201d and I mean it! That\u2019s how good life is. You get to\u2013 you get to fuck. That\u2019s free if you\u2019re smart. That comes with. That\u2019s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if you\u2019re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If you\u2019re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriend\u2019s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And it\u2019s nice and warm and tight in there, And he\u2019s your buddy. If you\u2019re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff they\u2019re doing, and\u2026 It\u2019s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read \u201cto kill a mockingbird.\u201d It\u2019s a great life. So, you know, I\u2019m not worried about it ending. \u201cBehind The Wheel\u201d\nIt\u2019s pretty good, and I\u2019ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I don\u2019t know. You know, it\u2019s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as they\u2019re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when I\u2019m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when I\u2019m behind the wheel, which is when I\u2019m at my most dangerous. When you\u2019re driving, That\u2019s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life \u2019cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet it\u2019s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind of\u2013I don\u2019t know\u2013 sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, \u201cworthless piece of shit.\u201d I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? \u201cWorthless piece of shit\u201d? That\u2019s somebody\u2019s son. And things I\u2019ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck did\u2013 I don\u2019t remember, even\u2013 And I yelled out my window, I said, \u201chey, fuck you!\u201d Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a person\u2019s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, \u201chey, fuck you!\u201d? \u201cworthless piece of shit!\u201d No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, there\u2019s nothing you would not say to them. \u201cI hope you die!\u201d I said that to a person. \u201cI hope you die!\u201d Why? \u2019cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!\u201d I mean, what am I capable of? I\u2019d like to think that I\u2019m a nice person, But I don\u2019t know, man. \u201cIf Murder Was Legal\u201d\nA lot of it is context. There\u2019s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d love to think, \u201cI would never do that,\u201d But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. We\u2019d like to think it\u2019s \u2019cause, Like, \u201cI would never do that.\u201d No. It\u2019s \u2019cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanor\u2013 Like you get a thing in the mail\u2013 \u201cshit, they had a camera there. Well.\u201d If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldn\u2019t trust somebody who didn\u2019t murder If murder was legal. You wouldn\u2019t like them. \u201cI never killed anybody.\u201d \u201cOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. \u201cI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. \u201cwhat\u2019s wrong with that guy? He\u2019s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.\u201d \u201cI think he\u2019s nice.\u201d \u201cshut up, Janet.\u201d They would just\u2013 If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, That\u2019s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, you\u2019d go to a mall, there\u2019d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall just\u2013 \u201cI told you to stop it! You didn\u2019t listen to me!\u201d Just\u2013pbbt! There\u2019d be just\u2013 You\u2019d be stepping over dead kids. There\u2019d be, like, a new problem. \u201cyou have to clean up your kids \u201cwhen you kill them \u2019cause it\u2019s gross. \u201cit\u2019s bad for the environment. \u201cif you murder your child in a public place, \u201cplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers \u201cevery three feet of America. \u201cput your murdered child in the red bag \u201cwith a logo of a murdered kid on it \u201cnext to the other logo that tells you \u201cnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag \u201cbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.\u201d That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought. \u201cOf Course, But Maybe\u201d\nYou know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thing\u2013 That\u2019s the thing I believe\u2013 and then there\u2019s this thing, and I don\u2019t believe it, but it is there. It\u2019s always this thing and then this thing. It\u2019s become a category in my brain That I call, \u201cof course\u2026 But maybe\u2026\u201d I\u2019ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybe\u2026 Maybe if touching a nut kills you, you\u2019re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. I\u2019d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybe\u2026 maybe if we all just do this for one year, we\u2019re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if you\u2019re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, it\u2019s a terrible tragedy, of course, of course\u2026 But maybe\u2026 Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, it\u2019s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, It\u2019s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So you\u2019re in this with me now. Do you understand? You don\u2019t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time it\u2019s happened\u2013 Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, it\u2019s a terrible, horrible thing, of course\u2026 But maybe\u2026 Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, \u201chow did they build those pyramids?\u201d They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew \u2019em up and didn\u2019t give a shit what happened to them. There\u2019s no end to what you can do when you don\u2019t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. That\u2019s where human greatness comes from, is that we\u2019re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where they\u2019re making these, They jump off the fucking roof \u2019cause it\u2019s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while you\u2019re taking a shit. Thanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.","mike":"Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We\u2019re here. This is crazy. It\u2019s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don\u2019t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I\u2019m arguing with. And the reason it\u2019s a source of tension is that I\u2019m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, \u201cWell, you don\u2019t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, I think it\u2019s insane, you know, for anyone.\u201d And she said, \u201cWhy?\u201d\nAnd I said, \u201cWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.\u201d You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That\u2019s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That\u2019s a learning curve.\nSecond of all, monogamy\u2019s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I\u2019m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we\u2019re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, \u201cWell, we like sex just as much as you do.\u201d And I said, \u201cSure, but it\u2019s different.\u201d And they say, \u201cHow?\u201d And I say, \u201cHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?\u201d\nNumber three\u2026 I\u2019m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that\u2019s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn\u2019t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that\u2019s the hopeful part. The, uh\u2026 I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he\u2019s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren\u2019t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were\u2026 we were pretty good. I mean, we weren\u2019t like the best in the world. I\u2019m sure there are better in Europe. But we were\u2026 we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, \u201cAre you sure this is what you want to do?\u201d And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren\u2019t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I\u2019m at Andy\u2019s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation \u2019cause he\u2019s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you\u2019re right. He says stuff like, \u201cShe sounds crazy.\u201d Like, even if what she\u2019s saying isn\u2019t that crazy, like, you\u2019d be like, \u201cShe only eats whole wheat bagels.\u201d He\u2019d be like, \u201cShe sounds crazy!\u201d You\u2019d be like, \u201cThat\u2019s not even the crazy part!\u201d You know. So I\u2019m telling him about his argument. And he goes, \u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d I go, \u201cI know. I\u2019m right.\u201d He goes, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d I go, \u201cI know I\u2019m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.\u201d And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I\u2019m driving out of Andy\u2019s small road, and I\u2019m t-boned! I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re familiar with this term, uh\u2026 This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver\u2019s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1\/2 seconds, I\u2019m spun around, and I think I\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh\u2026 No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I\u2019ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d And I said, \u201cI\u2019m writing my set list.\u201d And then she goes, \u201cI think it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, it won\u2019t be fine.\u201d And then she was like, \u201cI think it will be okay.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhy do you think that?\u201d And she said, \u201cWell, you look so nervous, I think they\u2019ll feel sorry for you.\u201d But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, \u201cIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.\u201d Normally, I\u2019d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, \u201cYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.\u201d She re\u2026 she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean\u2026 I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I\u2026 I\u2019d jus\u2026 I\u2019d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and\u2026 and then we weren\u2019t. And then when we weren\u2019t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and\u2026 But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don\u2019t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I\u2019m seeing a girl, she\u2019d think, \u201cI\u2019d have sex with him, maybe.\u201d You know, and I\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don\u2019t give off a great first impression. Like, I\u2019ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my \u201cA\u201d outfit. My \u201cB\u201d outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I\u2019ve reached this point in my life I don\u2019t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I\u2019m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like\u2026 But I don\u2019t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I\u2019m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I\u2019m like, \u201cCome on!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re blind if you\u2019re leaving the house like that!\u201d And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it\u2019s a close game \u2019cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I\u2019m all riled up. I\u2019m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I\u2019m like, \u201cNext time.\u201d You know, that\u2019s how I go for fried dough, \u2019cause I have a problem. I just\u2026 This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I\u2019m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I\u2019ve been going, uh, recently to a women\u2019s exercise class. I-I\u2019ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I\u2019m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh\u2026 It\u2019s going pretty well, you know. I\u2019m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I\u2019ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn\u2019t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I\u2019ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they\u2019ll have those\u2026 The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while\u2026 And I\u2019m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they\u2019ll fall, and it\u2019s ugly \u2019cause they\u2019re rolling around like, \u201cI\u2019m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don\u2019t even know how I got here.\u201d But at the end of that, no matter what\u2026 And I totally fall for it. I\u2019m like, \u201cthat can\u2019t possibly be the same loser \u201cFrom moments ago. \u201cI mean, that\u2019s a completely different person. \u201cThis person has much better posture, for starters.\u201d I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis \u2019cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don\u2019t know, and, uh\u2026 I didn\u2019t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh\u2026 Pfft. Which\u2026 yeah, I don\u2019t know if that was the best idea \u2019cause, uh, we\u2019re heading\u2026 We\u2019re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, \u201cOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOh, we can just swing back and get it.\u201d And she\u2019s like\u2026 she\u2019s like, \u201cNo, it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo, it won\u2019t be fine \u2019cause it\u2019s St. Patrick\u2019s day, and there\u2019s bouncers.\u201d And she goes, \u201cNo, it\u2019ll be okay.\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo, it won\u2019t be okay.\u201d And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they\u2019re like birthday clowns like, you know, \u201cWhat can I do to make your day better?\u201d\nYou know, and that\u2019s\u2026 We\u2019re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn\u2019t the idea. And so I said\u2026 I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh\u2026 But she warmed to me as the night went on \u2019cause she was drinking, and then, like\u2026 No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we\u2026 I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and\u2026 We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, \u201cSure.\u201d We get to her door, and I didn\u2019t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, \u201cOh, no, thank you.\u201d Which I thought was polite\u2026 But disappointing. I mean, there\u2019s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you\u2019re really putting yourself out there. You\u2019re just like, \u201cI think we should connect mouths,\u201d you know, and\u2026 The other person\u2019s like, \u201cI do not think we should connect mouths.\u201d And those are\u2026 They\u2019re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You\u2019re like, \u201cI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.\u201d This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I\u2026 I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember\u2026 I remember it like it was yesterday \u2019cause I was shocked. I was like, \u201cPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?\u201d \u201cBut how?\u201d You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, \u201cI am not doing that.\u201d And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, \u201cThat is fine. \u201cYou are not on the list. \u201cYou\u2019re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.\u201d I was like, \u201cPerfect.\u201d It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, \u201cI don\u2019t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.\u201d And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It\u2019s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That\u2019s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that\u2019s right? Okay, good. So\u2026 In seventh grade, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna make out with anybody.\u201d And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, \u201cwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. \u201cFirst order of business, Nintendo. \u201cSecond order of business, why doesn\u2019t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.\u201d I don\u2019t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared\u2026 I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, \u201cI got to try to get into the make-out club.\u201d But it was a very intangible goal. I didn\u2019t really talk to a lot of girls, and\u2026 There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had\u2026 I don\u2019t\u2026 The rest of the show is in old English. Uh\u2026 She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, \u201cOh, this is great. I got to do that more.\u201d And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well \u2019cause she goes, \u201cMike, you got to stop. I\u2019m gonna pee myself.\u201d And I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d This was the closest I\u2019d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that\u2019s how I ended up here. Yeah. That\u2019s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So\u2026 uh\u2026 So here\u2019s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, \u201cWell, maybe this will be like \u201cone of those romantic comedy montages. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to the carnival, we\u2019ll get stuck \u201cOn the top of the Ferris wheel, we\u2019ll make out. \u201cIt\u2019ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.\u201d But I think that when you\u2019re 12 years old, you just don\u2019t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don\u2019t know that you shouldn\u2019t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It\u2019s basically saying, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna take sugar, \u201cwhich everyone knows is bad, but then we\u2019ll dress it up like insulation.\u201d And I\u2019m like, \u201cI\u2019m not sure \u201cwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWe already sold it.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.\u201d I don\u2019t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the \u201cshits of pants-erator,\u201d and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said\u2026 They said, \u201cWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.\u201d And then one guy says, \u201cWell, what about the \u2018I think I\u2019m gonna die-erator\u2019?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cThat\u2019s good, \u201c\u2019cause it gets across the essence of how you feel \u201cwhen you\u2019re on the machine. \u201cPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, \u201cwhich is a nice homage \u201cto the original intention of the machine, \u201cbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.\u201d And then one guy goes, \u201cwell, what about the scrambler? \u2018Cause it scrambles you!\u201d They\u2019re like, \u201cWe get it, Frank, but who\u2026\u201d Frank is a maniac. This guy can\u2019t be stopped, but every once in a while, he\u2019s got a good idea. \u201cBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?\u201d And this one guy goes, \u201cwell, I have a nephew who\u2019s 16 years old \u201cand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201che sounds amazing. \u201cWe don\u2019t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.\u201d\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I\u2019m feeling good. Like, she\u2019s snuggling up close to me, and I\u2019m thinking\u2026 I\u2019m thinking like, \u201cthis could be it. \u201cThis could be where it\u2019s all gonna happen. This is very special.\u201d And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It\u2019s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s saved lives. I think the only thing it\u2019s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it\u2019s just sort of held someone\u2019s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don\u2019t talk about scrambler accident. That\u2019s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, \u201chey, actually\u2026\u201d And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn\u2019t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\nSo then I\u2019m scrambling, and\u2026 As I am scrambling, I\u2019m thinking, \u201cI need to come up with a plan of some kind. I\u2019m not going down without a fight.\u201d My first plan was very simple. It was just don\u2019t look at Lisa, don\u2019t look at any other people. I was like, \u201cdon\u2019t look at Lisa, \u201cdon\u2019t look at any other people. \u201cDon\u2019t look at Lisa, \u201cdon\u2019t look at any other people. I need a new plan.\u201d And\u2026 The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator\u2026 That he needed to stop the ride, but\u2026 The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I\u2019m like, \u201cI got to tell him he\u2019s got to stop the ride. \u201cI got to tell him he\u2019s got to stop the ride. \u201cI got to tell him he\u2019s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!\u201d And I\u2019m back! \u201cI\u2019m not sure he heard me. \u201cI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.\u201d The third time I said, \u201cplease stop.\u201d And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just\u2026 Popcorn, peanuts\u2026 Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I\u2019m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um\u2026 I\u2019m at the St. John\u2019s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John\u2019s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So\u2026 Cattle shows up at 8:00. We\u2019ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that \u2019cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss \u2019cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, \u201coh, have you had your first kiss?\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cyeah, like, all the time. Like, every\u2026 every week.\u201d I always feared at some point there\u2019d be a follow-up question like, \u201coh, yeah? What\u2019s it like?\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cyeah, you know, it\u2019s just like licking an ice cream cone.\u201d And they\u2019d be like, \u201cno, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s like sucking on a rocket pop.\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.\u201d I\u2019m at the dance, and I\u2019m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we\u2019re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, \u201cmoo!\u201d And we were like, \u201cmoo!\u201d And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we\u2019ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, \u201cyou get that one.\u201d Which I know it\u2019s the worst turn of phrase, but I\u2019m comfortable saying it \u2019cause I know I\u2019ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, \u201cyou get that one.\u201d And then her friend goes like, \u201coof.\u201d You know, or even worse\u2026 or even worse, like, \u201cyou owe me,\u201d which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone\u2019s credit score, you know. So he goes\u2026 he goes, \u201cyou get that one.\u201d And then I\u2019m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc\u2019s bust a move. And I\u2019m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it\u2019s only catching me one out of every five\u2026 Hey! So she\u2019s losing interest, but at 1\/5 the speed. And then I\u2019m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What\u2019s great about slow dancing is you can\u2019t really mess it up \u2019cause it\u2019s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She\u2019d be like, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d And I\u2019d be like, \u201cI don\u2019t pick up on social cues,\u201d you know. But it\u2019s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I\u2019m just trying not to fidget. I\u2019m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn\u2019t know anything about making out, but I\u2019d seen people do it. I could see there\u2019s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no\u2026 You know, there\u2019s no video documentation of that area. It\u2019s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They\u2019ve only seen it washed up on the shore\u2026 Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but\u2026 So I\u2019m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1\/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo\u2026 All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, \u201coh, no. I don\u2019t want to be alone anymore.\u201d And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it\u2019s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery \u2019cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, \u201cI\u2019m not alone anymore! I\u2019m not in the non-make-out club!\u201d And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn\u2019t because up until that point, I\u2019d lied and said that I\u2019d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, \u201chow\u2019d it go, dude?\u201d I had to be like, \u201csame as always. Pretty smooth.\u201d As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, \u201cwell, maybe it did go well, \u201cand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,\u201d but\u2026 I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn\u2019t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, \u201chey, you like full house? \u201cMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.\u201d You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, \u201cwhy are you calling me?\u201d And I remember thinking, \u201coh, I\u2019m probably reading into that one too much,\u201d and\u2026 And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, \u201coh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.\u201d But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn\u2019t even tell my friends, until one day I was\u2026 I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, \u201chey, what\u2019s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn\u2019t called me back.\u201d And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, \u201cwhat?\u201d Tom was like, \u201cnothing.\u201d And I was like, \u201cwhat?\u201d Tom was like, \u201cnothing.\u201d And I was like, \u201cwhat?\u201d Tom\u2019s like, \u201coh.\u201d \u201cI talked to Sandra, and she said \u201cyou\u2019re the worst kisser she\u2019s ever kissed.\u201d And it was so devastating \u2019cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn\u2019t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn\u2019t say, \u201cthat makes sense. I\u2019ve never done that before.\u201d So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, \u201cyeah, that sounds about right. \u201cI\u2019m a terrible kisser. That\u2019s kind of my thing.\u201d So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, \u201coh, no, thank you.\u201d She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be \u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\u201d A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn\u2019t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We\u2019re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, \u201ceveryone hates me at work,\u201d and I said, \u201cwhy would they hate you? I love you.\u201d She goes, \u201cyou love me?\u201d I go, \u201cI mean, you seem cool.\u201d I pulled it back. I didn\u2019t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, \u201cyou know, sometimes I\u2019ll date two people at once, and that way I\u2019m never let down by either person.\u201d I said, \u201cthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, I\u2019d like to do that as well.\u201d And she said, \u201cI\u2019m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you\u2019re seeing them.\u201d And I was like, \u201call right, sounds like a plan. \u201cGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.\u201d And so a few nights later, I\u2019m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I\u2019m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, \u201chow was your trip?\u201d And I said, \u201cit was great. I did some shows, \u201cand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.\u201d And that didn\u2019t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, \u201cbut I\u2019m right about that, right? Like, I\u2019m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?\u201d And she says, \u201cyeah, but it doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat I won\u2019t lose interest in you.\u201d And I said, \u201cthat\u2019s a whole new clause! \u201cThat\u2019s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?\u201d I said, \u201care you still seeing John?\u201d And she said, \u201csometimes.\u201d I said, \u201cwell, don\u2019t you see the contradiction in that?\u201d And she says, \u201cyes.\u201d And it gets very quiet\u2026 Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn\u2019t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda \u2019cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it\u2019s winter in New York, it is also winter\u2026 In Bermuda, and, uh\u2026 Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she\u2019s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I\u2019m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And\u2026 and Jenny\u2019s late. And then we get to security, and I\u2019m not making this up, she doesn\u2019t have a license or a passport. And I said, \u201cwhat do you mean?\u201d I go, \u201chow do you travel?\u201d And she goes, \u201cwell, \u201cusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.\u201d I don\u2019t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can\u2019t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what\u2026 what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they\u2019re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn\u2019t want that, unless they\u2019re lesbians, although there\u2019s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda\u2026 Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although\u2026 then they\u2019d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, \u201cI didn\u2019t even know I was a lesbian \u201cuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. \u201cAnd now that\u2019s all I\u2019m into. \u201cI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, \u201cthey\u2019d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me \u201cand 71 of my friends. But now I don\u2019t see Khalid in the same way anymore.\u201d The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we\u2019re on the flight\u2026 On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, \u201ccongratulations on your honeymoon.\u201d And we said, \u201coh, no, thanks. We\u2019re not on our honeymoon.\u201d And she walks away, and Jenny says, \u201cthat\u2019s so funny. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever go on a honeymoon.\u201d And I said, \u201coh, really?\u201d And she goes, \u201cyeah. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever want to get married in my life.\u201d And I said, \u201coh, really?\u201d I go, \u201cme too.\u201d I said, \u201cis that based on a principle, \u201cor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?\u201d And\u2026 She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was\u2026 they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they\u2026 you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, \u201cthen what?\u201d And she said, \u201che died. He had leukemia.\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?\u201d And she says, \u201cno, I don\u2019t really like to talk about it.\u201d But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we\u2019d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we\u2026 At one point, I was like, \u201cwell, we should do this again. \u201cWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.\u201d Jenny said, \u201cthat sounds great, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think I\u2019d get a license or a passport \u2019cause they don\u2019t make me get one.\u201d And I was like, \u201cyeah, but it\u2019s the law.\u201d You know. Jenny says, \u201cyeah, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll get one \u201c\u2019cause they don\u2019t make me get one, you know. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d That\u2019s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she\u2019ll just say, \u201cthat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cthat\u2019s not an argument.\u201d \u201cLike, we\u2019re not even in an argument right now because you don\u2019t have an argument.\u201d And she\u2019ll say, \u201cI just won that argument.\u201d And I\u2019ll say, \u201cthat\u2019s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.\u201d And she\u2019ll say, \u201cI just won that argument,\u201d again. \u201cThat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh\u2026 On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, \u201cwe should play.\u201d And I was like, \u201cyeah, but not, like, a game.\u201d And she said, \u201cwhy?\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, \u2019cause I\u2019d win.\u201d And she said, \u201cno, I think I would win.\u201d I go, \u201cno. I know that I\u2019d win, \u201cand I know that what I\u2019m supposed to say is that\u2026 \u201cThe guy says, \u2018I\u2019ll win,\u2019 the girl says, \u2018I\u2019ll win,\u2019 \u201cand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don\u2019t have that in me.\u201d And Jenny goes, \u201cyou don\u2019t have to let me win. Let\u2019s go out and play.\u201d And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like\u2026 It was just like\u2026 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone who\u2019s so obsessed with the score.\u201d And I said, \u201cthe score is what makes it a game!\u201d So we\u2019re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we\u2019re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re so obsessed with being right.\u201d I go, \u201cI\u2019m not obsessed with it. I just am.\u201d I said, \u201cwhy do you think you\u2019re right?\u201d And she says, \u201cthat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d I said, \u201cif you think I\u2019m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?\u201d And Jenny says, \u201cyou can\u2019t choose who you love.\u201d Which is true, but it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you\u2019re just like, \u201cthis is it. I found her. I\u2019m 17 years old, and I\u2019m done, you know.\u201d And\u2026 Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, \u201cit was totally messed up because it wasn\u2019t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.\u201d And I was just like, \u201cawesome.\u201d Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just\u2026 I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, \u201cdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?\u201d She goes, \u201cI don\u2019t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.\u201d And I was like, \u201cgood answer.\u201d\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She\u2019d be like, \u201cno one likes you at all. Only kidding.\u201d Or, like, \u201cyou\u2019re like a nerd, but you\u2019re not even smart. Just joking.\u201d Can\u2019t choose who you love.\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don\u2019t\u2026 I don\u2019t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a\u2026 It\u2019s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You\u2019d know when he was lying \u2019cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he\u2019d go, \u201cyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.\u201d And he wasn\u2019t even handling money. Like, I don\u2019t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He\u2019d be like, \u201cyeah, my uncle\u2019s Tony Robbins, \u201cmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.\u201d And\u2026 We found out that that wasn\u2019t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn\u2019t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that\u2019s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you\u2019re lying about big stuff. It\u2019s like banking.\nThe final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I\u2019m in the future also. I think we can all see now \u2019cause we\u2019re so smart, and Mike\u2019s so dumb, and, uh\u2026 You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that\u2019s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time \u2019cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, \u201cwell, this is the affirmation that I need. I\u2019m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.\u201d And I drive my mom\u2019s station wagon to Amanda\u2019s parents\u2019 house, and I walk in the front door, and there\u2019s Amanda, and there\u2019s her parents, and it\u2019s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I\u2019m assuming he\u2019s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I\u2019m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They\u2019re both in their first year in college, and they\u2019re competitive wrestlers, and\u2026 It\u2019s dawning on me that I\u2019m hanging out with my girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend. And it\u2019s going pretty well. I mean, he\u2026 He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, \u201cI wish it were just you and me here.\u201d And I remember thinking, \u201cyou could make that happen.\u201d The way she said it was as though she weren\u2019t involved in the decision process, like, \u201cI\u2019d love to, but the boys in corporate\u2026\u201d\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you\u2019re like\u2026 \u201cMaybe if this goes well, she\u2019ll see that I\u2019m good with adults in general!\u201d As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, \u201chow do you know Amanda?\u201d And I said, \u201cwe\u2019re just friends from school.\u201d And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, \u201cI am never gonna let this happen to me again.\u201d So\u2026 Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize \u2019cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful \u2019cause it was\u2026 In Texas. And I\u2026 that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It\u2019s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh\u2026 But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is\u2026 which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy\u2026 I love comedy clubs \u2019cause they\u2019re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they\u2019re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there\u2019s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they\u2019re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s actually a thing. I didn\u2019t even realize that\u2026 I didn\u2019t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was\u2026 was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if\u2026 And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I\u2026 but that\u2019s\u2026 that\u2019s not my job. I\u2019m\u2026 you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just\u2026 I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And\u2026 I\u2019d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, \u201cwhatever I can do to help. I don\u2019t see how this could end badly.\u201d And, uh\u2026 The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I\u2019m hung over, and I\u2019m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I\u2019m still two hours early, and\u2026 I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny\u2019s parents\u2019 house. And I walk in the front door, and there\u2019s Jenny, and there\u2019s her parents. And there\u2019s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn\u2019t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, \u201cwell, what\u2019s John doing here?\u201d And she says, \u201cwell, he and I aren\u2019t still together, \u201cbut when we were together, \u201che became friends with my stepdad, \u201cand he\u2019s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.\u201d And I said, \u201cyou know, that\u2019s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.\u201d Jenny\u2019s staring at me. And I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d She says, \u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s true.\u201d And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry.\u201d And she says, \u201cwhere is that from?\u201d And I said, \u201cthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.\u201d That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there\u2019s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and\u2026 We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn\u2019t have a leg to stand on. I was like, \u201cwell, what about John? What was he doing there?\u201d She said, \u201cyou have a hickey on your neck.\u201d I said, \u201cyeah, but at least I told you the truth.\u201d And she said, \u201ceventually.\u201d And I said, \u201ceventually is better than never!\u201d And then she kneed me in the balls. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever experienced this before. I\u2019m sure half of you have not. Uh\u2026 It\u2019s like being electrocuted, except you don\u2019t get to die. It\u2019s like you want to die, but you can\u2019t. And there\u2019s a person in your face saying, \u201cyou deserve this,\u201d which they wouldn\u2019t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\u00a0 Even in Texas.\nJenny says, \u201cI think that we should just break up. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not just this. \u201cI mean, you\u2019re away a lot of the time. \u201cAnd even when you\u2019re here, you work at night, \u201cand I work in the day. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna work out.\u201d And I said, \u201cokay.\u201d\u00a0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her \u2019cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I\u2019d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from \u201cJen, Irish pub, nice.\u201d And it would just say, \u201chi.\u201d And I\u2019d write back, \u201chi.\u201d It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year\u2019s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, \u201chey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.\u201d And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, \u201cwhat?\u201d And she says, \u201cI think that we should live together.\u201d And I said, \u201cno, I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve just decided, you know, as a principle, \u201cI\u2019m not gonna get married or live with someone. It\u2019s not personal.\u201d And she said, \u201cwell, unless we live together, \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s gonna work out \u201c\u2019cause we just don\u2019t see each other enough, \u201cand I don\u2019t think that we stand a chance. That\u2019s how I feel.\u201d So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, \u201coh, no, thanks.\u201d That doesn\u2019t go over so well. She says, \u201cwhy?\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, as you know, \u201cI don\u2019t believe in marriage, and so I don\u2019t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.\u201d She said, \u201cwell, what do you believe in?\u201d And I said, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d She said, \u201cwell, if you don\u2019t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, first of all, \u201cyou know, it just doesn\u2019t seem necessary. \u201cI mean, is it\u2026 you know, \u201cmarriage is an archaic institution \u201cinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a part of that. \u201cSecond of all, I don\u2019t even think we have \u201ca common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. \u201cI mean, one of me and Andy\u2019s friends \u201cwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, \u201cand we said, \u2018are you sure this is the person \u201cyou want to be with for the rest of your life?\u2019 \u201cand he goes, \u2018yeah, I think so.\u2019 \u201cand we said, \u2018well, what if she gets in a car accident, \u201cand she\u2019s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?\u2019 \u201cand he said, \u2018maybe\u2019! \u201cThat is not an acceptable answer! \u201cThird of all, if I\u2019m so in love, \u201cwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? \u201cAnd I\u2019m not one of these like, \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t want government up in my business\u2019 kind of people! \u201cI think the government does a nice job \u201cdelivering the mail and suggesting I don\u2019t eat poison, \u201cbut I just don\u2019t understand why they need to be involved \u201cin my personal relationships. \u201cThen finally, if marriage is religious, \u201cshouldn\u2019t I believe in the religion? \u201cI\u2019ve been to more weddings of my friends \u201cwhere the people on the altar don\u2019t believe \u201cin the religion of the church they\u2019ve invited us to! \u201cSome of them even go to classes with the priest \u201cin advance, to more elaborately lie \u201cabout believing in a religion they don\u2019t believe in \u201cjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! \u201cThat is insane! That\u2019s how I feel!\u201d So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, \u201cwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.\u201d And I said, \u201cwhy? Aren\u2019t you listening to any of this?\u201d And Jenny says, \u201cthat\u2019s how I feel.\u201d At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we\u2019d been arguing all night, and we hadn\u2019t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I\u2019m overtired, and I\u2019m angry, and I\u2019m late. I\u2019m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It\u2019s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn\u2019t even there. There\u2019s a guy with a laptop going, \u201cwe need a road, stat! What\u2019s the code for building, tank?\u201d You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn\u2019t even started yet. It\u2019s just an anchor looking around like, \u201cwhat are you up to?\u201d And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, \u201cwell, that ain\u2019t your gate.\u201d Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, \u201cI was not involved in this process. I wasn\u2019t even C.C.\u2019d.\u201d Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, \u201cB22. Like hell I\u2019m flying out of B22.\u201d And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, \u201cthis is where I\u2019m going.\u201d You know, I\u2019m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, \u201cwell, where is this gate?\u201d She goes, \u201cit\u2019s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.\u201d She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, \u201cand you better run.\u201d Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to run. I have wheels.\u201d And I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. \u201cI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I\u2019ll walk you in circles for a few hours.\u201d Then I\u2026 I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, \u201cperfect. That\u2019s exactly how long I want to wait.\u201d But the tram\u2019s riding away. I was like, \u201cthat\u2019s -1 minute!\u201d Then it says ten minutes, and I\u2019m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, \u201coh, great, I\u2019m gonna miss my flight, \u201cand then I\u2019m gonna miss every flight from now on, \u201cand I\u2019m gonna miss my family reunion. \u201cAnd then I\u2019m not gonna have a family, and then I\u2019m gonna be a crack whore.\u201d And it\u2019s like, all of a sudden, I\u2019m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and\u2026\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I\u2019m sweaty, and I\u2019m out of breath, but I\u2019m on time. And I\u2019m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I\u2019d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I\u2019m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that\u2019s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, \u201cdo you know these people?\u201d She was like, \u201call I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.\u201d I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, \u201cDrew Barrymore\u2019s character, come back!\u201d She didn\u2019t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I\u2019d missed my show. I\u2019d never missed one of my shows before, and I\u2019m so angry. And Jenny\u2019s calling me, but I\u2019m not picking up the phone \u2019cause I\u2019m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy\u2019s house, and I said, \u201cAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!\u201d And Andy goes, \u201cyou\u2019re right.\u201d I go, \u201cI know! I\u2019m right!\u201d He goes, \u201cyeah, you\u2019re right.\u201d I go, \u201cI know, I\u2019m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!\u201d I drive out of Andy\u2019s small road, and I\u2019m t-boned. That\u2019s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1\/2 seconds, I\u2019m spun around, and I think I\u2019m dead. No, wait, I\u2019m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I\u2019m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri\u2026 have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that\u2019s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn\u2019t\u2026 Doesn\u2019t start crying right away because it doesn\u2019t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it\u2019s like, \u201coh, I guess I should be doing something \u201cthat matches that. Waah!\u201d I\u2019m crying because I\u2019m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don\u2019t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I\u2019d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and\u2026 The officer comes over, and he says, \u201cwhat happened?\u201d And I said, \u201cI got hit by this car, \u201cand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.\u201d The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can\u2019t help but think, \u201cthat\u2019s karma. That\u2019s a hit and run and hit.\u201d And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, \u201csign this.\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, what does it mean?\u201d And he goes, \u201cit means you\u2019re okay and that we can leave.\u201d I was really shaken up. I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m okay.\u201d And he goes, \u201cjust sign it,\u201d which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you\u2019ve just said no to, and it\u2019s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours \u2019cause the other driver had beat us there, and\u2026 Eventually, we\u2019re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, \u201cwell, was the other guy drunk?\u201d And the doctor says, \u201cwell, I can\u2019t answer that.\u201d And Andy says, \u201cwas he?\u201d He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, \u201cwell, he\u2019s heading to jail now.\u201d And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, \u201ccase closed.\u201d A few hours later, we\u2019re back at Andy\u2019s house, it\u2019s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, \u201cI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.\u201d And Andy says, \u201cMike\u2026 Sleep on it.\u201d And I said, \u201cno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.\u201d And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, \u201cMike\u2026 Sleep on it.\u201d He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed\u2026 And I\u2019m not making this up\u2026 $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver\u2019s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, \u201cwell, this can\u2019t be happening.\u201d I explained to the woman, \u201cI think it\u2019s a misunderstanding. \u201cThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.\u201d And she said, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.\u201d So I requested the accident report, and I\u2019m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever seen one of these things before\u2026 But it\u2019s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1\u2026 that\u2019s me\u2026 started to go, but all of a sudden V-1\u2026 That\u2019s me also\u2026 Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I\u2019m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver\u2019s statement at the scene of the accident was, \u201cI was on Venice going\u2026 uh, I\u2019m not too sure. \u201cI was going away from the beach. \u201cI was driving. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happened. \u201cDid I hurt anyone? \u201cI don\u2019t know where I was going, \u201cbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.\u201d Which is really everyone\u2019s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That\u2019s what they serve these days at the home\/beach\/pub.\nSo all of it\u2019s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I\u2019m like, \u201cI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.\u201d The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know \u2019cause I\u2019m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I\u2019m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I\u2019m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, \u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\u2019s car.\u201d I know, and, I mean, that\u2019s what I said. I go, \u201caren\u2019t you listening to any of this?\u201d I go, \u201cand this guy was clearly drunk. \u201cI mean, he nearly killed me. \u201cInches from where he hit, \u201cand I would be dead right now. \u201cAnd he wants me to pay for his car? \u201cDon\u2019t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?\u201d And he says, \u201cdo the right thing, and pay for the guy\u2019s car.\u201d And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it\u2019s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I\u2019m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There\u2019s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, \u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\u201d And I said, \u201cno,\u201d and he says, \u201cdid you have any loss of income from the accident?\u201d And I said, \u201cno. This isn\u2019t about money.\u201d And he doesn\u2019t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\nI\u2019m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy\u2019s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, \u201cJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, \u201cbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.\u201d I was like, \u201cI\u2019m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. \u201cI\u2019m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I\u2019m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!\u201d At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, \u201chey, what\u2019s going on?\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s going on!\u201d I\u2019d tell them this whole story. And they\u2019d be like, \u201cyou should get a lawyer.\u201d I\u2019d be like, \u201cthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn\u2019t even touch this!\u201d \u2018Cause he wouldn\u2019t.\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she\u2019s talking to me, but I\u2019m not listening \u2019cause I\u2019m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I\u2019ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I\u2019m gonna call that week. And I\u2019m so angry, I\u2019m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I\u2019m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, \u201cwhat are you doing?\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, this is my case.\u201d And she says, \u201cwell, why don\u2019t you work on that in the morning?\u201d And I said, \u201cwell, which part of this napkin don\u2019t you understand?\u201d Jenny says, \u201cMike\u2026 \u201cYou\u2019re right, \u201cbut it\u2019s only hurting you, \u201cand I\u2019m just so glad that you\u2019re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.\u201d She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy\u2019s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn\u2019t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don\u2019t. But I believe in her, and I\u2019ve given up on the idea of being right. Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much! Thanks for coming here tonight and joining me.","ricky":"Hello. Hello! How you doing? Great. Thank you. Wow. Calm down. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. What a lovely welcome. I\u2019m gonna try my hardest tonight. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cRelax, we\u2019ve had our money\u2019s worth just seeing you.\u201d What? You\u2019re a legend. Shut up! What is he? I\u2019m not a god. I\u2019m just an ordinary guy, you know, going round talking to people sort\u2026 sort of like Jesus\u2026 in a way\u2026 but better. Well, I\u2019ve actually turned up. So\u2026 Thank you and welcome to my new show, Humanity. I don\u2019t know why I called it that. I\u2019m not a big fan. I prefer dogs\u2026 obviously. Dogs are better people than people, aren\u2019t they? They\u2019re amazing, dogs. They\u2019re our best friends. They guard us, they guide us. There\u2019s medical detection dogs that can smell if you\u2019ve got\u2026 AIDS. I\u2019m not a doctor\u2026 but their noses are a thousand times more sensitive than ours, so they go, \u201cCor, you\u2019re well HIV! Fuck!\u201d You know? And you go, \u201cYou can smell AIDS on someone?\u201d Yeah. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you smell it on the bloke I brought home last night, you fucking idiot?\u201d They did the first three billion years by themselves, evolution and all that. Then we got involved and did some selective breeding. Getting them how we wanted, to do jobs for us. Bit stronger, faster, whatever. They\u2019re great at the jobs they\u2019re bred to do. They love the job they\u2019re bred to do. They\u2019re genetically hardwired to love that behavior. Although, the Rhodesian Ridgeback was bred to hunt lions. I can\u2019t help but think it was a shock to it when it found out. So we\u2019ve got all the pedigrees for miles around. A big passing-out parade. There\u2019s a bloke with a white coat and a clipboard. He goes, \u201cRight, dogs!\u201d They go, \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cWho wants to know what job they got?\u201d \u201cWe all do. We all do.\u201d \u201cOkay, Labradors.\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDo you like carefully bringing back dead ducks?\u201d \u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d \u201cAmazing. That is amazing. That is my favorite job. That is my favorite job.\u201d \u201cJack Russells?\u201d -\u201cYeah?\u201d -\u201cYou like shooting down rabbit holes?\u201d -\u201cYeah!\u201d -\u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d \u201cFuckin\u2019 hell. Best day ever! Best day ever!\u201d -\u201cMiniature poodles?\u201d -\u201cYeah?\u201d \u201cDo you like being carried around by elderly homosexuals?\u201d -\u201cYeah.\u201d -\u201cThat\u2019s your job.\u201d That\u2019s your job. \u201cRidgebacks?\u201d \u201cYo!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re hunting lions.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re hunting lions.\u201d \u201cFuck off!\u201d -\u201cYeah, you are.\u201d -\u201cNo, we\u2019re not. Look, lions? We\u2019ll get fucking mashed! Why can\u2019t the Rottweilers hunt lions?\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re shaking babies.\u201d Good boy! Good boy! You shake that baby if you want. Good boy! Cheers. This is my first new stand-up for seven years, if you don\u2019t count the Golden Globes. Which you shouldn\u2019t. The Golden Globes.\u00a0Very different. God, a different vibe. Two hundred million people watching. And it\u2019s live. Big thrill. But with that many people watching, there\u2019s a bit of stick. Everyone\u2019s different, everyone\u2019s a blogger. Everyone goes, \u201cI was offended.\u201d -\u201cWhy?\u201d -\u201cHe said an horrible thing.\u201d \u201cHe said loads of horrible things.\u201d \u201cYeah, but that was a thing that I care about.\u201d That\u2019s the thing about offense, it\u2019s about personal feelings. I don\u2019t care about the backlash. \u201cComedian in hot water.\u201d You know? My girlfriend, Jane, she worries, and she reads things. \u201cWhat have you said?\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. They won\u2019t come to the house. Fuck \u2019em.\u201d So I wind her up. I pretend I\u2019m gonna say much worse things than I ever would. I have to make up worse jokes than I actually\u2026 Just to scare my girlfriend. When I do the Golden Globes, we go out about a week before. It\u2019s in LA. We fly out. I\u2019m writing jokes as the ceremony approaches. They release more presenters. I take my pick. \u201cI got a good intro for them. Yeah. Mel Gibson? I\u2019ll introduce him, yes.\u201d About three days before this last one, just to wind Jane up, I said, \u201cI got a good intro.\u201d She went, \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cBill Cosby would make our next presenter sleep on the couch. Please welcome Helen Mirren!\u201d I didn\u2019t do it. She said, \u201cYou won\u2019t do that?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d Next day, I got her again. I said, \u201cIs this too much?\u201d I said, \u201cNot even Bill Cosby carries enough tranquilizer to bring down this next magnificent beast. Please welcome Melissa McCarthy!\u201d I didn\u2019t do it! I would never\u2026 I\u2019d never\u2026 tell a joke like that. It\u2019s horrible. I was just doing it to annoy Jane. I\u2019d never even\u2026 think\u2026 of that, so don\u2019t\u2026 Even on the day, on the way to the red carpet, in the limo, I said, \u201cI\u2019ll start\u00a0with a funny one-liner. An old-fashioned joke.\u201d She went, \u201cWhat?\u201d I said, \u201cWhat did the deaf, dumb and blind orphan get for Christmas?\u201d Jane went, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d I said, \u201cCancer.\u201d I didn\u2019t do it, so\u2026 you\u2019re getting offended at a joke that doesn\u2019t exist, so\u2026 I\u2019d never say that in public, so\u2026 To anyone who mattered, anyway. So, don\u2019t\u2026 I didn\u2019t have to worry about offending anyone. It just happens. The big controversy last time I did it was a Caitlyn Jenner joke. Outrage on Twitter the next day. I mean a couple of people going, \u201cIt was transphobic.\u201d It wasn\u2019t transphobic in the slightest. It was a joke about a trans person, but it had nothing to do with that aspect of her existence. And that\u2019s the other thing about offense. People mistake the subject of a joke with the actual target. They\u2019re not necessarily the same. I\u2019ll tell you the joke, you make your minds up. It\u2019s live, so they go, \u201cYour host for the 68th Annual Golden Globes Awards, please welcome Ricky Gervais.\u201d They\u2019re all clapping, the actors are smiling at me. Nervously. It\u2019s brilliant, right? So, I just go, \u201cRelax, I\u2019m gonna be nice tonight. I\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner, obviously.\u201d And I go,\u00a0\u201cNow Caitlyn Jenner, of course.\u201d And what a year she\u2019s had. Became a role model for trans people everywhere, bravely breaking down barriers and destroying stereotypes. She didn\u2019t do a lot for women drivers\u2026\u201d That\u2019s a clever joke. I\u2019ll tell you why. Right? It\u2019s layered. No, listen, right? The subject of that joke is stereotypes. I\u2019m playing with the notion of stereotypes. I start by saying she\u2019s a real woman, a liberal, progressive attitude. Then if she\u2019s a real woman, I hit them with the old-fashioned stereotype. She must be a bad driver, then. Right? The target of the joke is a celebrity killing someone in their car. Let\u2019s not forget that, shall we? A celebrity killing someone in their car, running home and popping on a dress. That\u2019s\u2026 the target of the joke, just so we\u2019re clear. Okay? She was interviewed a week later at a\u00a0press conference for a show of hers. Now cancelled. And\u2026 one of the press said, \u201cWhat do you think of the Ricky Gervais joke?\u201d She went, \u201cMaybe I should host the Golden Globes.\u201d And they tweeted that and @-ed me in, because they want a celebrity feud. It was clickbait. I rose to the bait. Obviously\u2026 I just sent back, \u201cLet her host. Just don\u2019t let her drive.\u201d Another website that was in the room, Entertainment Weekly, they tweeted a different headline, and they @-ed me in. Their headline was \u201cCaitlyn finally breaks silence over Ricky Gervais.\u201d I just sent back: \u201cAt last. She always brakes too late.\u201d Bring it on. Bring it on. But I\u2019m a considered comedian. I like my jokes to be accurate and my targets to be fair. So I was engaging these people, saying, \u201cWhy is it transphobic?\u201d They said, \u201cIt\u2019s about a trans person.\u201d That\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s like saying a joke about Bill Cosby is automatically racist. It depends on the joke. But I\u2019m willing to learn. I found out my crime was that I dead-named her. I\u2019d never heard that term before a day after the Golden Globes. And that was saying her old name, and even acknowledging she used to be a man. But she did! I saw him on the Olympic Games! He was a decathlete,\u00a0he was in everything! All over the place! Shot put and pole vault. He won a medal! He was famous! He was on telly all the time, you know? A big\u2026 famous\u2026 man. With a huge\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m guessing. Probably. He was big. But I\u2019ve learnt my lesson. Now I know it\u2019s wrong. I\u2019d never dead-name her now. But, years ago, when she was a\u2026 man\u2026 Years ago, I\u2019m saying. And she went to the\u2026 doctor\u2026 and\u2026 knocked on the door. The doctor went, \u201cCome in!\u201d This is years ago. I\u2019d never dead-name her now, but this is like\u2026 a flashback before anyone\u2026 You know what\u2026 so\u2026 so, like, \u201cCome in!\u201d And he went, \u201cHello, Bruce Jenner.\u201d Because that\u2026 that was his name\u2026 then. The doctor\u2013 This was years ago\u2026 The doctor went, \u201cAll right, Bruce Jenner, how you doing, you fucker? You big old lunk. How you doing? Come here, you, you fucker. How you doing, Brucie boy?\u201d And Bruce Jenner\u2013 That was\u00a0his name. This is years ago. Right? So\u2026 Bruce Jenner went, \u201cYeah. Yeah, not too bad, Doctor. Yeah.\u201d \u201cWhat can I do for you, Bruce, you fucker? How you doing, boy?\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\u2013 That was his name. Bruce Jenner went\u2026 \u201cLook at that.\u201d The doctor went, \u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you know the rules.\u201d He uses his whole name every time, for some reason\u2026 \u201cCome on, Bruce Jenner, you fucker. You know the rules. You can\u2019t bring your big old pole vaulting pole in here, mate.\u201d Bruce Jenner went, \u201cNo, that\u2019s not my pole, that\u2019s my enormous penis.\u201d \u201cWell, seeing as it\u2019s your penis, you can bring it in here. But you should have left your shot puts outside.\u201d And Bruce Jenner went\u2026 That was his name for\u2026 fifty-eight years, I think. He went, \u201cNo, they\u2019re not my shot puts, Doctor, they\u2019re my enormous testicles.\u201d That\u2019s where I keep my testosterone, and my spunk, and shit, right? And the doctor went, \u201cOh yeah. That makes perfect\u2013 I\u2019m a medical man. You\u2019re a big bloke. You fucker. How you doing, boy? You\u2019re a big\u2026 You\u2019re big, and you would have a big old\u2026 cock and\u2026 balls. They\u2019re beautiful.\u201d Bit familiar, innit? \u201cNo, you must be very proud of them, Bruce.\u201d Bruce went, \u201cThis is going to surprise you, Doctor. I wanna get rid of them.\u201d And the doctor went, \u201cWhat? Why?\u201d \u201cOh, they get in the way.\u201d \u201cIn the way of what?\u201d \u201cFucking driving, for one thing!\u201d So, I\u2019m engaging these people, and I\u2019m saying, \u201cBut I had to say her old name. That\u2019s the joke. I say, \u201cI\u2019ve changed. Not as much as Bruce Jenner.\u201d Then I do the joke.\u201d But, no. This is my second crime. I say, she hasn\u2019t changed. She\u2019s always identified\u00a0as a woman. That means she\u2019s a woman. Fine, if that\u2019s the rules. If you feel you\u2019re a woman, you are. I\u2019m not a bigot who thinks having all that done is science going too far. In fact, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going far enough. Cause I\u2019ve always identified as a chimp, right? Well, I am a chimp. If I say I\u2019m a chimp, I am a chimp. Pre-op. But\u2026 Don\u2019t ever dead-name me. Don\u2019t call me Ricky Gervais again. From now on, you call me Bobo. I\u2019m gonna have species realignment. I\u2019m halfway there. I\u2019m short, with short legs and long arms. I stoop. My back\u2019s getting hairier by the day. I\u2019ve got fangs, like that. I love nuts. I love nuts. Once, I was at the zoo, and people were looking at me, so I just started masturbating, like\u2026 So\u2026 I am a chimp, right? I am a chimp if I say I\u2019m a chimp. I\u2019ve got to live as a chimp for a year. Then have hormones, get me all nice and hairy. That\u2019d be lovely. I\u2019m gonna stay a male chimp\u2026 so I can keep all that, right? Male, heterosexual chimp. Keep the same girlfriend. Jane would be happy. She loves me, she loves chimps, so\u2026 You know. I reckon that\u2019s got to be easier for a man to turn into a chimp, we\u2019re so close, than for a man to turn\u00a0into a woman, in many ways. A bit of hair, and a top lip like that, as opposed to your cock and balls ripped off\u2026 and a hole gouged out, into\u2013 I\u2019m not a doctor! But that is\u2026 the gist of it. I know which one I\u2019d rather have done. I\u2019m not saying chimps are better than women. No way. Right? Any ladies here? I can\u2019t see you, but, to me, every single one of you is equal\u2026 to a chimp. So\u2026 So, I\u2019d have all that done, hair and that. I\u2019d do all that, all the\u2026 I\u2019ll retain the ability to speak English. Like in emergencies. I\u2019m talking to Jane, she\u2019s going, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u201cWhat is it, Bobo?\u201d \u201cYou left the fucking oven on! There\u2019s a fire!\u201d Are you saying that if Caitlyn Jenner was being chased by a wolf, and there was a big fence but she had a long pole, she\u2019d\u2026 revert. She\u2019d be over that fucking\u2026 Easy. So I\u2019d have all that done. Top lip. Doing all that. Right? I\u2019ll be legally a chimp. I\u2019ll be well\u2026 properly chimped-up. I\u2019ll be able to use chimp toilets! I\u2019ll be walking along, holding Jane\u2019s hand. \u201cCome on, Bobo.\u201d Right? We don\u2019t hold hands now. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s all over me now I\u2019m a chimp. But we\u2019ll be all in love. Maybe matching jumpers. \u201cCome on, Bobo.\u201d In love. Just two\u2026 Like that. Then, if a bigot in a van slows down and goes, \u201cThat\u2019s fucking disgusting.\u201d I\u2019ll fling shit at him and run up a tree. And that\u2019s why that joke isn\u2019t transphobic. So\u2026 Cheers. So, humanity. What is humanity? What are we? Well, we\u2019ve touched upon it there. We\u2019re great apes. Not metaphorically! We\u2019re literally great apes. We are 98.6% genetically identical to a chimpanzee. We\u2019re closer to chimps than chimps are to gorillas. We left our common ancestor about six million years ago. We have the same life cycle. Same as any other animal. Which is\u2026 our parents mate\u2026 we\u2019re born\u2026 we grow\u2026 we mate\u2026 our parents die\u2026 our friends die\u2026 and then we die. Now\u2026 my seven-year-old niece didn\u2019t like hearing that. But I said, \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta learn. Stop crying.\u201d I said, \u201cYou\u2019re seven. You know\u2026 today. So\u2026 Any more grizzling and this party\u2019s cancelled, so\u2026\u201d Let\u2019s take the first of those. Birth. It\u2019s odd, because a human is born before the end of its natural gestation period. I mean, because of our evolution, our brain is so big, we have to get that huge head out early. That\u2019s why the skull is in parts and supple. Then we go on gestating outside the womb. That\u2019s why we\u2019re so useless. Look at other mammals. A giraffe is walking along. It goes, \u201cI\u2019m proper pregnant.\u201d Right? I\u2019m gonna have a baby giraffe right here. Yeah, there it is. See you later. And the baby goes, \u201cMum!\u201d It\u2019s got to be fucking ready. We\u2019re\u2026 we\u2019re helpless, right? Just think, nine months we\u2019re growing in this perfect environment. Everything\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s like being in a little Kate Bush video, right? Then, suddenly, you\u2019re being squeezed out of an hole near an ass. You\u2019re covered in shit, there\u2019s screaming. You go, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d Someone goes, \u201cYes, you fucking can!\u201d The first one second of life\u00a0on Earth. You don\u2019t know where you are. You can\u2019t choose where you\u2019re born. I was\u00a0born in Whitley Estate in Reading, right? I wouldn\u2019t have chosen that. I\u2019d have chosen Hampstead. I did choose Hampstead. It just took\u00a045 years to be able to afford it. Very different. Very different, my upbringing to how I live now. Now I live a privileged life. Hampstead is ridiculous. It\u2019s a rarefied place. It\u2019s like the grandchildren of poets and painters and me, new money, right? But, growing up, it was tough! I don\u2019t know about now, but in my day, my estate was rough and scary. It felt like wildlife. I was weak and vulnerable. There was danger round every corner. My school was on my street and I ran there every day, so I didn\u2019t get mugged or molested. There weren\u2019t many pedophiles\u00a0in Reading, the murderers had killed a lot. But there was still a couple. I moved to Hampstead. Oh my god! There\u2019s no crime! I saw a knife once in Hampstead. It was a palette knife. Just a bloke, oil painting, in the middle of the street. Broad daylight, no-one gobbing on it or calling him \u201cbender\u201d. It was weird! I know my life has changed drastically, It wasn\u2019t always like that. As a famous person, you read about yourself. Gossip and Twitter and everything. One thing kept cropping up, even as I prepared for this tour. People kept saying, \u201cHe\u2019s out of touch. He\u2019s so famous. He\u2019s rich. He\u2019s mega-rich.\u201d I am. Right? I could have this place burnt down for a laugh. No, but they say things like, \u201cHe\u2019s an observational comedian. How can he say things that relate to ordinary\u2026 scum.\u201d And I say.. I say, \u201cDon\u2019t call them scum, right?\u201d But even the papers, they try and\u2026 get around to it. I do interviews and they\u2019ll always say, \u201cDo you always fly first class?\u201d I go, \u201cNo. Often private.\u201d Right? The number of times I\u2019ve answered this question. They say, \u201cDo you know how much a pint of milk is?\u201d To make you look out of touch. I don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s irrelevant. Next time a journalist asks me, I\u2019ll say, \u201cI don\u2019t know. But here\u2019s\u00a0a grand. Run and get me one.\u201d Is that enough? That enough? Yeah. Another question I always get, particularly with the posh Sundays, doing a profile piece. They\u2019re still trying to alienate you, make you look different. They say things like, \u201cYou don\u2019t have children.\u201d I say, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have children?\u201d Which is an odd question. Why don\u2019t you have children? As opposed to asking people, \u201cWhy do you have children?\u201d Let\u2019s ask the fat lady in the leggings why she\u2019s had eight, shall we? Nine! That one just fell out. That one didn\u2019t even touch the sides. Or\u2026 disturb her cigarette. That one just\u2026 Go and claim for that. People say it\u2019s selfish to not have children. How is it selfish to not bring\u00a0a life into the world that doesn\u2019t exist on any level? There\u2019s not a cabinet full of potential ghost fetuses going, \u201cWe want to be born!\u201d Right? But I\u2019ve thought about it and there\u2019s three reasons I don\u2019t have children. Three main reasons and I\u2019ll share them with you. Three reasons. One. There\u2019s millions! The world\u2019s over-populated. No-one\u2019s going, \u201cRick\u2019s not having kids. We\u2019re gonna run out. Fuck.\u201d Two. Kids are scroungers. Aren\u2019t they? I mean, from day one, it\u2019s all \u201cme, me, me\u201d, isn\u2019t it? \u201cFeed me.\u201d \u201cClothe me.\u201d \u201cPay for my chemotherapy.\u201d No\u2026 No. Not my problem, son. Not mine. Luck of the draw, boy. Luck of the draw. It costs the average household in the West $200,000 to bring up a child. And they don\u2019t want to pay you back. They\u2019re not grateful. They don\u2019t go, \u201cThanks for having me.\u201d It\u2019s \u201cI didn\u2019t wanna be born.\u201d Even if they get a top job, which they won\u2019t, you\u2019ll never see that money back. They\u2019ll just put you in a home, okay? And my kid, he\u2019d be born into ridiculous wealth, wouldn\u2019t he? So\u2026 He\u2019d be a little cunt. A little Hampstead cunt\u2026 running around with all the other fucking little Hampstead cunts, being all Hampstead and cunty. \u201cI\u2019m a little Hampstead cunt.\u201d Yes, I know. \u201cThese are my cunty friends.\u201d I know, it\u2019s obvious. I can tell from your little fucking cunty hats that you\u2019re little Hampstead cunts, you little posh Hampstead\u2026 First, he\u2019d know he was a little Hampstead cunt. \u201cI\u2019m a little\u2026\u201d Yes, we know. Everyone knows, right? He\u2019d know that, right? On the other hand, he\u2019d know he\u2019d never live up to being as brilliant as his dad. I\u2019d say, \u201cI worked my way up from nothing, and you\u2019re just a useless Hampstead cunt.\u201d He\u2019d go, \u201cYeah.\u201d And that would probably prey on his little mind a bit. Eleven, twelve, he\u2019d be naughty, run with the wrong crowd, try and get out from under my shadow. Then he\u2019d turn to drugs. About 30, he\u2019d come home, and overdose on my Afghan rug. Twenty grand, that was, right? And as he was there, convulsing, and throwing up his fucking lungs, right, and with his little posh, high-pitched, fucking death rattle\u2026 his little fucking dying words, he\u2019d go, \u201cDo you love me now, Daddy?\u201d No! No. No, I never did. That\u2019s why you\u2019ll never be born, you useless, fucking junkie, Hampstead cunt. And, three\u2026 I\u2019d worry sick about him. You know? No I would!\u00a0I\u2019ve only got a cat now and I worry sick about her. I check the door three times when I go out, so she doesn\u2019t escape. I put food and water in every room in case the door shuts and she\u2019s peckish. A human baby? Oh my god, the responsibility of a human life? I\u2019d watch it sleep. You know? We said how weak and vulnerable they are. Oh, my god! You perfect little thing. Oh, you flesh of my flesh. Now, go to sleep in your expensive cot, like that. Night, night. Sleep tight. Don\u2019t let the bedbugs\u2026 Dead. Yeah. Just\u2026 Why? Why is it dead? It\u2019s just fucking dead, look! Fuck\u2019s sake! Fucking hell. What the\u2026 What a fucking waste of time that was! Fuck\u2019s sake. Embarrassing. \u201cJane?\u201d -\u201cWhat?\u201d -\u201cCome here.\u201d -\u201cI\u2019m in the shower.\u201d -\u201cCome here.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cFucking dead already. I didn\u2019t\u2026 Just fucking\u2026 Fucking hell, Jane. You call that a baby? That is\u2026\u201d If Jane was out, I\u2019d have to text her, wouldn\u2019t I? What could you\u2026 \u201cBaby\u2019s dead.\u201d She\u2019d come back. \u201cWhat the fuck?\u201d I\u2019d go, \u201cYep\u2026 Forget the Pampers. LOL.\u201d But even if it made it through the terrifying cot years, and it was a toddler running around head height to my antique tables, with their sharp edges. I\u2019d have to pad them so it didn\u2019t run into it, cave its head in and die. Then Social Services come round and say, \u201cIs this your child, Mr. Gervais?\u201d -\u201cYeah.\u201d -\u201cWhat happened here, then?\u201d I go, \u201cIt\u2019s a fucking idiot.\u201d I did think of adopting for a while. A little third world child. Because that would tick all three boxes. One, I wouldn\u2019t be adding to the population problem. I\u2019d be alleviating an existing problem. A young kid born, through no fault of his own, into abject poverty, he would have died, I can literally save his life, and give him a great upbringing. Right? Two. He would be grateful, wouldn\u2019t he? He\u2019d wanna pay me back, woudn\u2019t he? Particularly if I let him know the\u00a0other kids in the village weren\u2019t so lucky. They didn\u2019t\u2026 They didn\u2019t make it out. Right? I\u2019d tell him that early on, so he really bucked his ideas up. I\u2019d go, \u201cTunde, come here. Come here. Yeah, yeah. Go and pop a shirt on, you\u2019re not in Africa now. That\u2019s better. Yeah. Tunde, look\u2013 Yeah! Water straight out of a tap, innit? Yes! Yeah. Yeah! No, it\u2019s not free. It\u2019s Hampstead, you know, but\u2026 Yeah, course it\u2019s safe. Safe, fresh drinking water. Have as much as you want. Have a bucket full. Fresh drinking water. There you go. Go and clean the car. Go on.\u201d No, I\u2019d go, \u201cLook. Remember all your friends in the village back in Africa? They\u2019re all dead. A rich man didn\u2019t save them and bring them to Hampstead. -Do you wanna pay me back?\u201d -\u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cYeah, I bet you do.\u201d The good thing about them is, they can start work when they\u2019re about\u2026 six. I just call up Nike and I go\u2026 \u201cDo you still make your stuff in sweatshops? Got a great little worker here, yeah. Pound a day\u2019s fine. He\u2019s gotta start somewhere. And, three\u2026 if he ran round and caved his head in\u2026 and died, and Social Services came round and said, \u201cIs this your child, Mr Gervais?\u201d I\u2019d go, \u201cDoes it look like mine?\u201d I\u2019d go\u2026 \u201cThis is Hampstead. It\u2019s obviously broken in.\u201d That\u2019s why I don\u2019t have kids. Even though I don\u2019t have children of my own, people still show me photos of theirs, like I give a shit. I don\u2019t mean my own family. They\u2019ve given up. I\u2019ve got older brothers and sisters. They\u2019ve had loads of kids. And their kids have kids, and then their kids! There\u2019s about 50. I don\u2019t know\u00a0all their names. I see them at Christmas. It\u2019s all \u201cUncle Ricky!\u201d They know I\u2019ve got a bit of cash. They go through my pockets, and then fuck off. It\u2019s like being mugged by mice, right? I don\u2019t mean them, I mean strangers. I could be busy, I could be working, like on the set of a TV or film or something, stressed, producing or directing it. You get someone who\u2019s in for one day, with one line, or a stuntman, they introduce themselves. \u201cGood. Be with you in a minute.\u201d Then they hover. -\u201cBusy?\u201d -I go, \u201cYeah! Yes. Yeah.\u201d They go, \u201cWorking the weekend?\u201d I go, \u201cNot filming, but I\u2019ll be in the edit.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m taking my youngest to ballet lessons.\u201d \u201cAh. Great. Great.\u201d \u201cYeah, she\u2019s eight.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got a photograph.\u201d I go, \u201cYou know what? Show me it if she goes missing. I\u2019ll keep an eye open in the woods.\u201d You\u2019ve gotta go through the whole polite rigmarole, and go, \u201cShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201d It\u2019s gotta be long.\u00a0Too short, it\u2019s awkward. They know. You go, \u201cYeah, right.\u201d Too long and it\u2019s like, \u201cShe\u2019s\u2026 She\u2019s fucking beautiful.\u201d It\u2019s a minefield, innit? So\u2026 I\u2019m not out of touch. But I am spoiled. There\u2019s a difference. I didn\u2019t have any money until I was 40. I\u2019ve got the same family, friends and values. But I am spoiled. Because opportunity and privilege spoils you. And it doesn\u2019t take much. I\u2019l give you an example. When I first made it in America, the next time we flew, we\u2019re met by a bloke in a suit and a thing. And he just walked us past the queue and straight out the other side. The first time, you\u2019re horrified. \u201cEveryone\u2019s looking.\u201d Pretending to be late, baseball cap. Oh, god. Next time we flew, I went, \u201cWhere\u2019s that bloke? I\u2019m not queueing!\u201d It\u2019s quick! When I fly to the States, I\u2019ve got a place there, but I\u2019m always working. So, someone else is paying. So, I go first class. BA. It doesn\u2019t get any better. Even if I was paying, I\u2019d still go first class, but Jane would probably be in coach\u2026 It\u2019s ten grand a pop! That new Planet of the Apes movie\u2019s on. She\u2019ll love that. She\u2019ll be up for that. But when someone else is paying, I say, \u201cJane, get up here with me.\u201d Right? Front two seats\u2026 They board us early. We\u2019re on the plane about 15 minutes before anyone else. God. They bring round these snacks, these warmed, caramelized nuts in a bowl. Champagne. It\u2019s great. It\u2019s like a day off. No phone or anything. It\u2019s like\u00a0a holiday, flying to the States.\nI could do without the safety video. That\u2019s always a bit of a downer. And totally pointless. If you hit the side of a mountain at 500 miles per hour, the brace position does fuck all. Imagine if that worked. You\u2019re going down, the plane smashes. You go, \u201cI\u2019ll try it.\u201d You do that. Ball of flames, you wake up, everyone\u2019s dead. You go, \u201cFucking hell, that\u2019s amazing, that is!\u201d And they always use that voice, don\u2019t they? That calming, hypnotic voice, like, \u201cNothing bad will happen.\u201d They\u2019re saying horrendous things, but nothing bad will happen, because I\u2019m using this voice, don\u2019t worry. Things like, \u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water\u2013\u201d It smashes the fuck to bits, right? They say, \u201cIn the event of the plane landing on water, your life jacket is equipped with a whistle.\u201d A fucking whistle. So, the plane hits the water, smashes to bits, everyone\u2019s dead, except you, by a miracle. You\u2019re bobbing around in the Atlantic Ocean. Four degrees, that water is. You\u2019ve got about 15 minutes before hypothermia sets in. Or you\u2019re eaten by a shark, or you drown. You\u2019re hoping they\u2019ve sent air-sea rescue. You\u2019re going, \u201cGod, I\u2019m\u00a0gonna die, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m doing!\u201d Hold on! I mean, Air Sea Rescue\u2026 I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been\u00a0in a helicopter. O course you haven\u2019t. But\u2026 They\u2019re fucking loud. It\u2019s like having your head in a washing machine. You have to wear ear plugs and defenders. Your teeth rattle. It\u2019s like\u2026 Like that. Over the Atlantic Ocean at night. Never gonna happen. If you crash, you die, right? But apart from that, it\u2019s brilliant. Right\u2026 I was flying Heathrow to JFK just before Christmas, right? Boarded us early, on the plane. She comes round. \u201cChampagne in a wine glass, like you like it, Mr. Gervais.\u201d She goes off. I go, \u201cHave you got\u00a0any of them warm nuts?\u201d She went, \u201cWe\u2019re not handing out nuts on this flight. A lady\u2019s getting on who\u2019s so allergic, even someone eating nuts nearby would cause her to have a fatal reaction.\u201d I went, \u201cOh, my god, of course.\u201d I was fuming. I mean\u2026 What\u2019s that got to do with me? Why can\u2019t I eat nuts, just cause\u2026 fucking\u2026 this woman will\u2026 die, right? Nuts! How has she lived this long? If walking by a nut kills you\u2026 if being\u2026 just near a nut\u2026 How has she never been near a nut\u2026 before? And how has she lived long enough, having never been near a nut, how has she lived long enough to earn enough money to be near me on a plane, right? Honestly. It\u2019s\u2026 And if being near a nut kills you, do we really want that in the gene pool? I mean\u2026 I never wanted nuts more. I felt she was\u00a0infringing on my human right to eat nuts. And this is how spoiled I am, okay? I actually had this thought. I thought, \u201cOh, I wish I\u2019d brought my own nuts on.\u201d Right?. I thought for a second, but that wouldn\u2019t work. She\u2019d get on and start blowing up like a frog, right? Like that\u2026 And\u2026 die. And someone would go, \u201cRicky Gervais brought his own nuts on.\u201d You know, right? So I don\u2019t take my own nuts on. Now, before I fly, I have a shower, and then I rub myself all over\u2026 in nuts\u2026 just in case. Then I go, \u201cCan I have any nuts?\u201d They go, \u201cNo, sorry, this lady would die.\u201d \u201cYeah, not a problem.\u201d Lady gets on, sits down, starts blowing up like a frog\u2026 I go, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d I touch her all over. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d She goes, \u201cNuts!\u201d Right? And dies. And I go, \u201cWho\u2019s been eating nuts?\u201d I get off scot-free. So I got to America, I went on a chat show. Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. And I told that story, the whole thing. It went well, audience laughed. Great. Went out. Next day on Twitter, outrage. By \u201coutrage\u201d, I mean one person going, \u201cHow dare you?\u201d This woman goes, \u201cI saw you on\u00a0Jimmy Fallon, making fun of nut allergies. My daughter\u2019s nut-intolerant. How dare you?\u201d I go, \u201cWho is this woman?\u201d She\u2019s tweeted 15 times. She starts @-ing NBC and Jimmy Fallon. I go, \u201cWhat\u2019s this? How many followers? Twenty-three. Ignore it.\u201d You know when you\u2019re being told off, and they use your own words against you, like a teacher going, \u201cSo, you find so and so funny?\u201d And cause the teacher\u2019s really angry, yes, you do find that thing funny, whatever\u2026 She said\u2026 \u201cWould you find it funny if my daughter blew up like a frog?\u201d Yeah. Yeah, you saying that\u2026 Yes. If you said that at the funeral, I would, yeah\u2026 So, someone else gets involved. Ohio Moms Against Nuts, right? And she does a blog, and they\u2019re talking to each other, and she puts me in her blog about how disgusting I am. One filmed her little girl, put it on YouTube, and sent me it. I opened it. Sweet little girl, seven years old. And she went, \u201cDear Mr. Gervais, I have a fatal nut allergy.\u201d Delete. Not my problem, right? Ignore. Ignore. Ignore. Right? But then one of them said something that reeled me in. Just cause I\u2019m this self-confessed Twitter police. I try and explain to someone every day what freedom of speech means, particularly in the context of comedy, and in the context of a joke. A joke about a bad thing isn\u2019t as bad as the bad thing, or necessarily condoning the bad thing. It could be anti the bad thing. It depends on the actual joke. And this woman said\u2026 \u201cYou should never make jokes about food allergies.\u201d I should have left it, right? I sent back, \u201cI make jokes about AIDS, cancer, famine, and the Holocaust. And you\u2019re telling me I should never joke about food allergies?\u201d She sent back, \u201cYes,\u00a0but the Holocaust didn\u2019t kill children.\u201d Well\u2026 it did, didn\u2019t it? It was horrible, the Holocaust. Some would say as bad as food allergies. \u201cDidn\u2019t kill children\u2026\u201d Jesus. It did kill children. Hitler killed 12 million people, many of them children. I have to say, Hitler, you couldn\u2019t make him up. The worst human being to walk the face of the Earth. He is a crazy\u2026 evil, racist, narcissistic serial killer. Just terrible. But\u2026 if I was throwing a dinner party, and I\u2019d been slaving over a hot stove, and I was getting everything ready, and there was one place left, and I had to\u2026 either invite Hitler or that little girl with food allergies\u2026 I know who\u2019d ruin that party more. Everyone\u2019s enjoying it. \u201cEverything okay?\u201d \u201cJa, ist\u00a0yummy!\u201d Right? He\u2019s loving it. I go, \u201cCheers, you fucker! How you doing, boy?\u201d She\u2019s going, \u201cI can\u2019t eat that.\u201d Fucking hell. \u201cWho wants Ferrero Rocher?\u201d \u201cMe!\u201d \u201cAll right. Here!\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t eat them.\u201d Oh, fuck off home. Right?\nThat\u2019s what the world\u2019s like. People see something they don\u2019t like, they expect it to stop, as opposed to deal with their emotions. They want us to care about\u00a0their thing as much as they do. It\u2019s why the world is getting worse, and the world is getting worse. I think I\u2019ve lived through the best 50 years of humanity\u2026 1965 to 2015, the peak of civilization, for everything. For tolerances, for freedoms, for communication, for medicine. Now it\u2019s going the other way a bit. Last couple of years, just a little blip, maybe. I\u2019m not saying this because I\u2019m old. Old people say things like, \u201cOh, everything was better when I was a kid.\u201d Course it was. You were a kid. Everything\u2019s better when you\u2019re a kid. Being old is the shit bit. Whatever\u2019s happening, being old is\u2026 I wake up these days, and I go, \u201cOh fuck, I didn\u2019t die.\u201d Gotta do it all again. I\u2019m usually hung over, headache, liver pains. I can\u2019t walk for the first five minutes, \u2019cause I\u2019ve got no joints in my knees. I\u2019m getting fat again now, right? I was thin till I was about 28,\u00a0proper skinny, like nine and a half stone. Then I got a job, right? And the next, sort of, 20 years were what I call my eating years\u2026 And I just got steadily fatter and fatter. Until I reached a peak of unwellness and blobbiness, when I was about 48 years old. There was one Christmas, I was at home, lying on the floor\u2026 And\u2026 I was saying to Jane, \u201cI\u2019m having a heart attack.\u201d Right? And, honestly, my heart rate was like 130. I felt nauseous, I had palpitations, I was sweating. Because I\u2019d eaten eleven sausages. True story, right? I was like one of them snakes. Like when you see a big, like\u2026 python swallow a pig whole. And then it\u2019s just fucked. It\u2019s, like\u2026 it\u2019ll sit there for a week. It\u2019s like a duffel bag. Just there, like that. That was me, right? I wasn\u2019t having a heart attack, but it worried Jane. She said, \u201cYou gotta look after yourself.\u201d I thought, \u201cYou\u2019re right. 48.\u201d So I started working out, right, every day. I didn\u2019t give anything up. I don\u2019t eat meat anymore. But I was having 2500, 3000 calories\u00a0a day, including wine every night. But I burnt it off the next day. Just so I could do all that, I worked out every day, running, weight training\u2026 I had more time on my hands than the average person. I had a gym in my house, I had no excuse. I lost 20 pounds. It was great. But now, I still eat and drink too much, but I physically can\u2019t\u2026\u00a0burn off the calories. I can\u2019t do enough. Cause I\u2019m so old and broken and tired. So, I\u2019m going to get steadily fatter and fatter again, and this time I am going to die. I\u2019m losing my hair. It\u2019s getting really thin. I know it looks great from there. Cheers, but\u2026 No, honestly, in a lift, with that light directly overhead, and the mirror, it looks like an x-ray, right? I\u2019ll have to buzz that off soon. I\u2019d never wear a wig, oh, my god. If you wear a wig or a toupee, and you think you\u2019ve got away with it\u2026 you haven\u2019t. Everyone knows. Everyone knows immediately. My brain knows a wig\u00a0has come into the room before I do, right? I could be at a party, it\u2019ll go, \u201cThere\u2019s a wig in here.\u201d -I go. \u201cIs there?\u201d -\u201cYes! There is, yeah!\u201d Spidey senses for the wig. It\u2019s obvious. The way they smile, like nothing\u2019s wrong. Hiya. It\u2019s the telltale signs, isn\u2019t it? I was put off wigs for life by my uncle Reginald. Great bloke. He\u2019s dead now. Died a few years ago. I was only little. He went bald in his twenties. Tragically bald. His hair fell out. It might have been something like alopecia. But he was bald for ten years into his thirties. Turns up one day at our house\u2026 \u201cElvis! What is\u2013\u201d I was about eight, I said to Auntie Edna, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She went, \u201cIt was a miracle.\u201d They were lying! They were just\u2026 Everyone knew he was bald! But he\u2019d embroiled his family in the lie, so they had to lie as well. They\u2019re going, \u201cYeah, it just grew back.\u201d There\u2019s so much he wouldn\u2019t do, cause he was terrified of the wig coming off. We weren\u2019t allowed balloons at parties, right? Auntie Edna said, \u201cReg is allergic to balloons.\u201d He wasn\u2019t allergic. He was terrified one of us kids would rub one on our sweater, and his wig would fly across the room. We\u2019ve got photos in the family album. If he\u2019s at a wedding or a christening, and he\u2019s holding a baby, it\u2019s always at arms\u2019 length. Like that. So it can\u2019t grab his wig. It must have been on his mind all the time, right? It was the only thing he feared, the wig coming off in public, and this ridiculous lie being exposed. He was in the Army, hard as nails. He wasn\u2019t scared of anyone or anything. Spiders, snakes\u2026 cancer\u2026 How\u2019s the chemo going, Uncle? \u201cNot a problem.\u201d We\u2019ve got a photo of him, the last year, I think. He was 75. It must have been the last year he was alive. It was a hot day. He was in the garden. In his little trunks. He was a wizened little man by then. White chest hair. Jet black wig still! Died in it, buried in it. He\u2019s wearing it now. A little skeleton with jet black hair. Like Posh Spice for eternity. But I knew that was gonna happen. I knew I would get old and fat and\u2026 ill and blind and deaf and\u2026 shit myself and be pushed round in a fucking bucket. You\u2019re ready, because you\u2019re warned. You know about getting old. What they don\u2019t talk about, so you\u2019re not prepared, and it was a shock to me\u2026 I only found out recently, I\u2019ll share it with you now. The distending testicles. See, you don\u2019t know about it. But it happens in your fifties. I wasn\u2019t checking them or anything\u2026 I didn\u2019t see \u2019em for 20 years. As a young man, they were pert, and now they\u2019re like two plums in a sock. I don\u2019t know when it happened, but it was recently. They just\u2026 And this is how I found out. So, as I\u2019ve been getting older, and they\u2019ve been secretly stretching away\u2026 as I\u2019ve got older, I\u2019ve got richer, so my baths have been getting more luxurious. Last year, I moved into a new house in Hampstead. Big bath. Big sunken bath. South-facing windows. I was in there the first night. Lovely bath. Sun streaming in, classical music, this is the life. I looked down. And they\u2019re floating. Right? Now, I\u2019d never dreamt that testicles would float. They seem like they\u2019d be heavy. You could tie things down with them, and they\u2019d sink. You know? Most people never see their\u2026 In the sea, you\u2019re in trunks, in the shower, they dangle, and baths aren\u2019t usually that deep! That was my first thought. \u201cOh, my god, I never thought testicles would float.\u201d Then my second thought kicked in. \u201cHold on, this bath\u2019s two feet deep!\u201d Right? I\u2019m sitting on the bottom, they\u2019re on top. What\u2019s going on? Right? And\u2026 I looked, and my testicles are now longer than my penis. Easily, by some way, right? In fact, they\u2019d created, a little, fleshy sort of life raft, right? My penis was dry, just nestled, just\u2026 floating on top. Like that. Like that. Just bouncing around. I should have given it a little whistle. I\u2019m just thinking, \u201cThis is bizarre.\u201d Fucking hell, right? And\u2026 I thought, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a fluke.\u201d So I held them under the water for a minute, I let them go and they bobbed up! They\u2019re really\u2026 They\u2019re really buoyant, right? Try it when you get home, if you\u2019re in your 50s. And a man, obviously. Or Caitlyn Jenner. But\u2026 But the world is getting worse. And I blame the beginning of its demise on social media. Because Twitter and Facebook, that\u2019s where this ridiculous notion bred, and became stable, that it was more important to be popular than right. Everything was \u201clike me\u201d, \u201cagree with me\u201d. It falls into two tribes. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with them, so I block them.\u201d And now, in this post-truth era, people don\u2019t care about the argument, they say, \u201cWho\u2019s saying the argument? No, they\u2019re not on our side.\u201d It\u2019s ludicrous, okay? And it also bred this ridiculous notion we\u2019ve always had. My opinion is worth as much as yours. Now, it\u2019s my opinion is worth as much as your fact, which is nonsense. I get tweets from people saying, \u201cI believe the Earth is 6,000 years old.\u201d \u201cI believe you\u2019re a fucking idiot.\u201d You can\u2019t have an opinion on the age of the Earth. You can have opinions, but not your own facts. But it was all about being popular, right? And even politicians picked up those symptoms. Politicians tweet now, they want to be popular. We had a Brexit referendum cause they passed the buck. They didn\u2019t want to make a mistake. And there\u2019s a ridiculous thing of, \u201cLet\u2019s ask the average person what they think.\u201d Let\u2019s stop asking the average person what they\u2026 Do you know how fucking stupid the average person is? We still sell bottles of bleach with big labels on that say \u201cDo not drink\u201d. Right? Let\u2019s take those labels off, right? For two years. And then have a referendum. But it\u2019s not just politicians. Even real news. The news on TV says things like, \u201cTweet us your news.\u201d Don\u2019t let them tweet you the news! -\u201cI saw a Tyrannosaurus rex.\u201d -You liar! Right? There was a big news story last year, about a train crash that happened a year before, and there was an inquiry. The results of the inquiry were published and there was an expert on the news. He said, \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at everything, and we\u2019ve decided that the speed of the trains was a contributing factor, so we\u2019re going to slow them down a bit. Statistically, this shouldn\u2019t happen again.\u201d That would have been it. But the guy went, \u201cWe asked the public what they thought.\u201d Then there was three banal vox pops. First one said, \u201cI already pay \u00a3960 a year, so I\u2019m not happy.\u201d The next one said, \u201cIt takes me 45 minutes each way, it\u2019s not good enough.\u201d The last one said, \u201cI say it\u2019s better to arrive at work late than dead.\u201d Why is that on the news? And when is that applicable in any situation? All right, Ted? You\u2019re in early. Ted? Oh, Ted! We\u2019ve been through this. Remember I said I\u2019d rather you arrive late than dead? But\u2026 the big enemy is stupidity\u2026 right? I wanna share with you the most stupid tweet I ever got. Now, admittedly, when I first got on Twitter, I pushed my agenda. I was an outspoken atheist. Not to change anyone\u2019s opinions. I thought it was important to tell the other side. There are still 13 countries where people are put to death for being an atheist. I just wanted to say, \u201cIt\u2019s fine to be an atheist. It\u2019s fine to believe in God, and it\u2019s fine not to.\u201d That\u2019s all I was saying. I realized I didn\u2019t have to tweet about religion or atheism. I could tweet a fact, and that annoyed just the right people. I\u2019d tweet things like \u201cHappy birthday, Earth. Four point six billion years old today.\u201d Someone would always go, \u201cWe know what you\u2019re fucking doing.\u201d This is a tweet I got\u00a0after one of those. And\u2026 it was all in capitals, which excited me\u2026 That\u2019s the sign of Twitter madness. Mixed with anger. It\u2019s great, right? I looked at his profile. Sure enough, he\u2019s a gentleman from Texas. He\u2019s a fundamentalist, creationist Christian. Which is fine! He loves God. He loves God and\u2026 fetuses, mainly. He loves the fetus from conception to when it turns out gay, and then he\u2019s\u2026 Remember it\u2019s in capitals. He\u2019s shouting at me. Best tweet ever. \u201cYOUR SCIENCE\u2013\u201d My science, right? Science, by the way, is spelled S-C-I-E-N-T-S. Already good, isn\u2019t it? I mean\u2026 He\u2019s obviously heard the word, he took a guess\u2026 Never seen it written down, because it\u2019s not in the Bible. So he\u2019s\u2026 \u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\u2019T HELP YOU\u2026 Well, it will. It\u2019s helping him\u2026 beam this little message up to a satellite and down to me. \u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN\u2026\u201d Of course he believes in Satan. Why not? He believes that God made the universe in six days. You\u2019re not gonna say to him, \u201cDo you believe in Satan?\u201d And have him say, \u201cBit far-fetched.\u201d Why doesn\u2019t God kill Satan? That\u2019s\u2026 what I\u2019d ask him. If I was wrong and I met God, I\u2019d go, \u201cOh, you do exist.\u201d He\u2019d go, \u201cYeah.\u201d I\u2019d go, \u201cI\u2019ve got a few fucking questions, mate. The first one would be, \u201cWhy did you make chocolate kill dogs?\u201d Mental, right? Also, if you hate homosexuality so much, why did you put the male G-spot up the arse? What\u2026 What is wrong with you? Then I\u2019d say, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kill Satan?\u201d And he\u2019d go, \u201cWhat?\u201d I\u2019d go, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kill Satan? If he does all the bad stuff and you do\u00a0all the good stuff, which you want\u2026 I mean, you do want\u2013\u201d \u201cYes, yeah.\u201d \u201cYou could kill him if you wanted, you can do anything, easy.\u201d \u201cYeah.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you kill him, then?\u201d \u201cBecause\u2026 Shut up.\u201d \u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS.\u201d And he\u2019s got a point. Because if I die, and I find myself in Hell, being raped by Satan\u2026 Science has pretty much let me down. But it\u2019s this last line that he just throws away. The line he signs off with, makes this the best tweet I\u2019ve ever received. \u201cYOUR SCIENTS WON\u2019T HELP YOU WHEN SATAN IS RAPING YOUR BRITISH ASS. I\u2019LL BE LAUGHING.\u201d So\u2026 he\u2019s there too! He\u2019s\u2026 So, he\u2019s a fundamentalist\u2026 Christian, who\u2019s lived his life by the Old and New Testaments. He dies, he wakes up in Hell, right? Which must be off the charts on the scale of emotional trauma\u2026 \u201cOh, my God, I\u2019m in Hell! Oh, my God, why have you forsaken me? I\u2019m gonna be tortured for eternity!\u201d He sees me getting raped and goes, \u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d He\u2019s suddenly over it, is he? His day\u2019s suddenly got a little bit brighter. And like he\u2019s not next, right? So I\u2019m getting raped, right, by the Devil, right? He\u2019s just there. \u201cYou fucking atheist scum.\u201d And I\u2019m like that. \u201cYeah, whatever.\u201d I assume it happens all eternity. \u201cYeah, yeah, whatever.\u201d Like that. I might say, \u201cWatch your hooves on my testicles.\u201d And he\u2019d go, \u201cWhy are they so distended?\u201d And I go, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re Brad Pitt!\u201d You know what I mean? Sorry, are we talking or raping? Can we\u2026 \u201cYou lying, fucking atheist.\u201d He\u2019s probably bored. \u201cFucking atheists. Every fucking day.\u201d Right? His little gargoyle comes up. \u201cSatan?\u201d He goes, \u201cWhat?\u201d And I go, \u201cYeah? What?\u201d He goes, \u201cThere\u2019s a fundamentalist Christian.\u201d \u201cFuck this!\u201d He\u2019d be on him like a ton of bricks! So\u2026 I got that tweet. I loved it. All I did was re-tweet, right? And just watch the fun, people piling on, going, \u201cAh, loser!\u201d And he\u2019s fighting back, really witlessly, saying things like, \u201cGo fuck your sister, you English faggot!\u201d That makes no sense at all. I forgot about it. Went and did something else. Few hours later, on Twitter again. It\u2019s still all going off, right? It\u2019s really funny, I\u2019m laughing at all the replies. People saying things to him. I\u2019m scrolling down. There\u2019s one tweet, directly to me, from this woman. She says, \u201cYou find rape funny?\u201d No! No! What? No\u2026 \u201cYour mates find rape funny?\u201d No! Listen, right? \u201cYou find rape funny?\u201d Listen, everyone! Listen, right? No\u2026 I said to her, \u201cI didn\u2019t tweet that.\u201d -She went, \u201cYou retweeted it.\u201d -To show he\u2019s an idiot. \u201cBut you must find it funny or amusing. It\u2019s not a frivolous thing.\u201d I said, \u201cNo, well, it\u2019s up to him, isn\u2019t it? He can do it.\u201d Now I\u2019m arguing with quite a nice, sane person, who thinks this is mental. But I\u2019m fighting for his right\u2026 to fantasize about me being raped by the Devil. Because I\u2019m so conscious of \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d\u2026 What a topsy-turvy world, right? Although her opening gambit annoyed me a bit. Because she did that thing that people do. She didn\u2019t say, \u201cWhat, you find jokes about rape funny?\u201d She said, \u201cWhat, you find rape funny?\u201d The answer to that is, no, of course not. No one finds rape funny. Not even rapists find rape funny, know what I mean? Noone ever gives evidence saying, \u201cIt was dark, he wore a ski mask, and he was giggling.\u201d That\u2019s never\u2026 So\u2026 I sent back, \u201cYou mean jokes about rape?\u201d She said, \u201cYes.\u201d -I went, \u201cDepends on the joke.\u201d \u201c-It fucking doesn\u2019t!\u201d I\u2019m going, \u201cNo, it does! It does! It depends on the joke. It\u2019s about context,\u00a0it\u2019s about content. What do you mean by a rape joke?\u201d She said, \u201cEven a joke with the word \u2018rape\u2019 in it is unacceptable.\u201d I said, \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous, it depends what the joke is.\u201d I tweeted that clip of me in The Office, going, \u201cI think there\u2019s been a rape up there!\u201d Everyone gets that because of the context. And the target is a middle-aged man, who\u2019s so narcissistic, he\u2019ll say anything to win a silly game. You have to understand the joke and where it comes from. I said,\u00a0\u201cSome jokes don\u2019t punch up or down. They don\u2019t punch anywhere. They can just be a pun, a play\u00a0on words, that don\u2019t really mean anything.\u201d A joke went round when I was a kid, even adults told it. I\u2019ll tell you. A woman goes running into a police station. She says, \u201cHelp, I\u2019ve been graped!\u201d The policeman says, \u201cDo you mean raped?\u201d She says, \u201cNo, there was a bunch of them.\u201d That is a rape joke, right? So\u2026. And I even said to her, \u201cNo, I agree, in most cases, yeah. Real rape jokes,\u00a0they are fucking horrible when the victim is the target. Disgusting! I\u2019d never tell those. But it depends on the joke, not the word or the subject.\u201d I calmed it down, and they agreed some jokes are worse than others. She ended it by saying, \u201cWell, okay, I see your point, but\u2026 still\u2026 I will laugh at a joke with the word \u2018rape\u2019 in it, when no-one in the audience has been raped.\u201d I should have left it. I just sent back, \u201cWhat a weird door policy.\u201d You turn up to a comedy gig, pay your money, someone says, \u201cCan I just ask you a question?\u201d Yeah. Have you ever been raped? I have, yes. You can\u2019t come in. What? Why? A lady says she won\u2019t laugh if you\u2019re in. Off you go. That\u2019s what the world is like. People take everything personally. They think the world revolves around them, particularly on Twitter. I\u2019m not tweeting anyone, I\u2019m just tweeting. I don\u2019t know who\u2019s following me. I\u2019ve got 12 million followers. They can be following me without me knowing, choose to read my tweet, and then take that personally. That\u2019s like going into a town square, seeing a big noticeboard saying \u201cGuitar lessons\u201d, and you go, \u201cBut I don\u2019t fucking want guitar lessons!\u201d What\u2019s this? There\u2019s a number here. Right, call that. Are you giving guitar lessons? I don\u2019t fucking want any! Fine! It\u2019s not for you, then. Just walk away. Don\u2019t worry about it.\nI should say one thing in Twitter\u2019s defense. I use it as a marketing tool and for fun, like everyone else. But one great thing about Twitter, for me, personally, I\u2019m very into anti animal cruelty. Years ago, it would take ages to get 100,000 signatures on a petition. Standing outside Tesco\u2019s or something. That\u2019s the magic number, because then it gets heard in Parliament. I\u2019ve been part of many campaigns through Twitter when we\u2019ve got 100,000 signatures in days, and the law has been changed. Thank you to those who\u2019ve retweeted about animal cruelty. It makes a difference. Thank you. But even something as clear and distinct as animal cruelty, You think no one\u2019s gonna argue with that. Yes, they will. They just wanna be heard. I\u2019ll tweet something about a bull being tortured in a bullring for entertainment. I say, \u201cBan bullfighting.\u201d Someone always says, \u201cWhat about the kids in Syria?\u201d What? Well, I\u2019m not giving you a choice. You can do both. I\u2019m not saying, \u201cThrow that kid back in the hole, there\u2019s a bull here!\u201d And there\u2019s one thing that I didn\u2019t want in my head, but it exists, so we have to deal with it now that I found out, through Twitter. There\u2019s a thing called the Yulin Dog Meat Festival, in China, every year. And it\u2019s horrendous. And we send people with money to buy the dogs, to bring them back. It\u2019s a drop in the ocean. They eat thousands over this weekend. I tweet the details, the petition, people don\u2019t really read it. It\u2019s a knee-jerk. People say, \u201cRacist!\u201d I go, \u201cWhat?\u201d They go, \u201cWe eat pigs and cows in the West.\u201d Yep, we do. I don\u2019t but, yeah, I used to. You\u2019re right, a pig or a cow is worth as much as a dog. It\u2019s not about the species. It\u2019s what they do to these poor dogs. What they do is torture the dogs first. \u2018Cause they think it makes the meat taste better. They beat them, they blowtorch them. They even skin them alive. And I saw this picture\u2026 on Twitter of the opening of this ceremony. These two guys, in this Chinese square, and they\u2019re skinning this dog alive. It\u2019s screaming, they\u2019re laughing. It\u2019s the worst thing I\u2019ve ever seen. I thought, \u201cI\u2019ve got to tweet that.\u201d I tweeted the picture, with a petition, and I just said, \u201cOne beautiful creature, and two ugly cunts, skinning it alive.\u201d Right? And it took off. Loads of retweets, it made the press. I got one tweet back, from a woman, that said, \u201cIs that language necessary?\u201d I should have left it, right? But I was\u2026 I was incensed! I said, \u201cYou\u2019re more offended by a word than by an animal being tortured to death?\u201d She said, \u201cI just hate the C-word.\u201d I definitely should have left it. I sent back, \u201cPeople who hate the C-word would hear it a lot less, if they didn\u2019t go round acting like such cunts.\u201d Thank you! You\u2019ve been fantastic! Good night! Cheers! Thank you so much! Thank you so much. I hope you enjoyed the show. I hope no-one was offended. No, I really do! That\u2019s not the point. I\u2019ve always wanted people to know they can laugh at bad things, without being bad people. I think it\u2019s my upbringing. I grew up\u2026 in poverty, with nothing. But the point was to pay your way then have a laugh. That was the men. The women carried on working. It was my older brother, Bob, it was him who I first saw making these dark jokes, right in the bad situation, as things were happening. People were laughing. I realized, \u201cHe\u2019s healing them.\u201d That\u2019s what comedy\u2019s for, what humor\u2019s for. It gets us over bad stuff. Right? Typical Bob story. He once spent an hour in the pound shop in Hayling Island, just asking the cashier how much everything was. Just to see if he could break this poor man\u2019s will. Bob was the first person I saw answer back to authority. The first authority you come across are your parents. And he\u2019d get in trouble. He got sent to bed. But I thought he\u2019d won the argument. And he\u2019d tease my mum. My mum was a typical working-class woman. As I say, we lived in a shitty area, right? And most of the houses looked like a bit of mud, and a stolen bike, and fence posts missing. She mended the fence, turfed the garden herself, painted the step. She thought, \u201cIf it looked\u00a0respectable, we\u2019d be respectable.\u201d It was about reputation, I guess. Bob would send her postcards that just read, \u201cIs that pedophile postman still reading your mail?\u201d And she\u2019d take it, she\u2019d go in, and she\u2019d be horrified. She\u2019d call Bob. \u201cHe saw it this time, you must stop doing that!\u201d Even at her funeral\u2026 My mum died first, and my dad carried on for a year or so, just drinking beer, then he went. At Mum\u2019s funeral, we had different duties. I did catering and flowers. Bob went to see the local vicar. That was a mistake, right? We\u2019d never been to church, he didn\u2019t know us, we didn\u2019t know him. So, he said to Bob, \u201cTell me about your mum, so I can say a few words.\u201d Bob saw that as an opportunity, right? So, Bob, with a straight face, said, \u201cWell, she was a keen racist.\u201d The vicar went, \u201cI can\u2019t say that.\u201d Bob said, \u201cOkay, put she liked gardening.\u201d He was trying to get\u00a0the vicar to say something to make us laugh in church. He didn\u2019t warn us. And he did get something by the vicar. So we\u2019re called Ricky, Robert\u2013 Bob\u2013 Ricky, Robert, Marsha and Larry. Now, Larry is the oldest, in his seventies. Born in the war. I always thought he was the sensible one. First born, weight of the world on his shoulders. My mum said, when he was a teenager, he got a job and gave her the money to help out. He\u2019s a stand-up guy, Larry. So, Bob\u2026 gives the vicar the wrong name. Didn\u2019t warn us. We\u2019re all in church. Start of the funeral, we\u2019re all there. Packed out. The coffin comes down. Guided by the vicar. The vicar goes to his pulpit. All confident, with his little notes, right? And he goes\u2026 Eva leaves behind four loving children. Ricky. Robert. Marsha. And Barry. And\u2026 we snort like that, right? Bob\u2019s going\u2026 Everyone realizes. We\u2019re all laughing. We see Larry go\u2026 All right. And the church is like\u2026 Every time we thought of it, we\u2019d see Larry go\u2026 Like that, right? Then we\u2019d just start giggling, just fits of fucking giggles, right? Larry eventually started doing this. And the vicar\u2019s thinking, \u201cWhat have I said?\u201d Right? He\u2019d put in a few things the vicar didn\u2019t know that set us off again. Things that were just lies, or slightly wrong. My nieces and nephews started crying. I\u2019d come prepared with a pack of tissues. They\u2019d take one and hand it on. Before the funeral, I\u2019d taken the tissues out, written on them, folded them back and put them in. And each tissue said, \u201cSnivelling fucking bitch.\u201d And they\u2019re sort of laughing. So it was like a madhouse, right? Everything the vicar said or did, we all\u00a0started fucking laughing! Right? And you could see the vicar was visibly shook a little bit. He ended the funeral, and he made a beeline for me and Bob. He said, \u201cSorry, was that okay?\u201d Me and Bob went,\u00a0\u201cFucking brilliant,\u00a0mate. It was fucking brilliant.\u201d That\u2019s what I mean. We\u2019re all\u00a0gonna die, so we should have a laugh. If you can laugh in the face of adversity, you\u2019re bullet-proof. Me and my brother, Bob, had one simple rule, and that was if you think of something funny, you\u2019ve got to say it. Win, lose or draw. It might go well\u2026 it might go badly. But you\u2019ve gotta say it. And bear that in mind, as I leave you with this. Right\u2026 So\u2026 we\u2019re all in the car one day. Bob\u2019s driving. Packed in this car. A little day trip to the beach. We get stopped for a security check. And there\u2019s a British bobby there. And he stops the car. Bob\u2019s at the window. He said, \u201cWhere are we off to?\u201d Bob went, \u201cBognor.\u201d He went,\u00a0\u201cCan you just pop the boot, please?\u201d So he looks at that. Looks in the boot, like that. Back to Bob\u2019s window. Gets that mirror on a stick thing. And he starts just looking under the car. And as he does that, his helmet falls off, right? And out of the helmet falls a packet of 20 cigarettes. And the copper went, \u201cBet you always wondered what we kept under our helmets.\u201d And Bob went, \u201cI knew it wasn\u2019t fucking brains.\u201d You\u2019ve been amazing.
